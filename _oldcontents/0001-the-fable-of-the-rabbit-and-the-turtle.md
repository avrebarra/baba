title: The Fable of the Rabbit and the Turtle
hook: In a lush green forest, a fast rabbit named Zeca and a slow turtle named Tita lived peacefully. When Zeca challenged Tita to a race to the tallest tree in the forest, little did he know that the outcome would teach them both a valuable lesson. Who will emerge as the true winner in this race against speed and patience?
moral: Hurry does not always lead to victory, and patience and determination can be more valuable than speed.
