title: O Lobo e o Cordeiro
hook: On a sunny day, a wolf was drinking water by the stream when it spotted a lamb approaching to quench its thirst. The wolf, always hungry, didn't t hesitate and thought, 'I will seize this opportunity to satisfy my hunger.' Will the lamb escape the wolf's cunning intentions, or will it fall victim to the wolf's plans, revealing the true nature of these forest companions?
moral: Greed can blind our judgments and lead us to commit unjust acts. We must act with kindness and respect, as we will reap what we sow.
