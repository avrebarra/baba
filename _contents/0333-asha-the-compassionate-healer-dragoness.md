Asha was flying gracefully through the lush green trees when she heard a loud cry for help. Curious, she followed the sound to find a baby monkey stuck in a thorny bush, unable to free itself.

"Oh no, what happened, little one?" Asha asked gently, landing beside the scared monkey. The baby monkey explained that it was chasing a butterfly and got tangled in the thorns.

Using her gentle claws, Asha carefully removed the thorns one by one, soothing the monkey with her kind words. "There, all better now," she smiled warmly as the baby monkey hugged her tightly.

Grateful and relieved, the baby monkey thanked Asha for her kindness. They shared a sweet moment of friendship before the monkey ran off happily to rejoin its family.
