In a cozy barn nestled among rolling hills, lived the lively Granny Trio - Baba, Biba, and Buba. One sunny afternoon, they gathered around their cow, Clara.

Baba insisted, 'Clara loves sleeping on soft hay!' Biba shook her head, 'No, she prefers the cool grass.' Buba chimed in, 'She curls up on the ground.' The grannies couldn't agree on Clara's sleeping spot!

To settle the debate, they decided to observe Clara at night. Much to their surprise, Clara shifted from hay to grass to ground, enjoying all equally. The grannies giggled at their fuss.

With newfound understanding, the trio hugged, 'Clara is happy with choices. Let's embrace differences, like she does!' From then on, they cherished each other's unique ways.
