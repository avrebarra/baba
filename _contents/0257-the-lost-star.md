In the joyful village of Rainbowville, Twinkle felt sad because it couldn't find the path to the sky.

"Don't worry, Twinkle," said Flutter, the wise butterfly, "Let's ask Sparkle, the magical firefly, for help."

Together, they searched for Sparkle and found him near the shimmering pond. Sparkle whispered, "To reach the sky, you must follow the moon's reflection on the water."

Excited, Twinkle followed the moon's reflection and flew higher and higher until it finally reached the night sky and lit up brightly.
