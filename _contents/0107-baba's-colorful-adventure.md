Little Baba loved to draw, but she only had boring old crayons that couldn't make her pictures colorful enough.

One day, while playing at the park, she stumbled upon a sparkling box of magical crayons hidden under a tree. The crayons shimmered in every color imaginable!

Excitedly, Baba ran home to try them out. She drew a sunny yellow sun, a grassy green tree, and a sky full of blue fluffy clouds. But suddenly, the red crayon broke, and she couldn't finish her rainbow.

Baba felt sad, but then she remembered the magic of mixing colors. She carefully blended the blue and green crayons to create a beautiful turquoise for the rainbow's missing part.

With her new colorful creation, Baba felt proud and learned that even when things don't go as planned, there's always a way to make them bright again.
