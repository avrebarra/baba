Baba skipped into the kitchen, excited to eat her special cupcake. But to her surprise, it was gone! She looked around, puzzled.

"Mama, where is my cupcake?" Baba asked with a frown. Mama replied, "I didn't eat it. Did you ask Baba the cat if he took it?"

Baba found Baba the cat sleeping under the table. She gently woke him up and asked, "Baba, did you eat my cupcake?" Baba the cat meowed in reply.

Feeling a bit sad, Baba decided to search the house. As she peeked into the living room, she saw a trail of crumbs leading to behind the sofa.

Curious, she tiptoed closer and found her missing cupcake half-eaten by a tiny mouse! The mouse looked scared but hungry.

Instead of getting mad, Baba smiled and said, "It's okay, little friend. Next time, just ask for a piece, okay?"
