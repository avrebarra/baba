One bright day in the Enchanted Forest, a little caterpillar named Keira wanted to explore the Garden that only opened at night. "I wonder what magical creatures come out when the stars shine," she thought to herself.

Excited to satisfy her curiosity, Keira sneaked out as the sun set. As she ventured deeper into the Garden, she encountered a mischievous firefly named Finn. "What are you doing out so late?" asked Finn, surprised to see a caterpillar at that hour.

Keira explained her curiosity, and together with Finn, they discovered glowing mushrooms and a sparkling pond. But soon they came across a prickly hedge blocking their way out of the Garden. "How will we get back home now?" whimpered Keira in worry.

Determined to help his new friend, Finn flew ahead and found a hidden passage under the hedge. With his guidance, they safely made their way back. Keira learned that being curious was fun, but it was important to stay safe and ask for help if needed.
