One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her garden when she stumbled upon a shimmering golden seed.

"Wow, what could this be?" Baba exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder.

Curious and excited, she decided to plant the seed in a small pot filled with rich soil.

Days went by, but nothing seemed to grow from the golden seed. Baba watered it every day, hoping for a miracle.

One morning, as Baba checked on her beloved seed, she noticed a tiny sprout peeking through the soil.

"It's growing, it's growing!" Baba cheered, jumping with joy.
