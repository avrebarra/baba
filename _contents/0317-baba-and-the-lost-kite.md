Once upon a time, Baba was playing with her favorite kite in the backyard. As she ran around, the kite suddenly caught a strong breeze and soared high into the sky, slipping from her grasp.

"Oh no, my kite! Come back," Baba cried, watching it drift further away. She felt a pang of sadness in her heart.

Determined to get her kite back, Baba decided to search for it. She asked her cat, Mittens, and her colorful parrot, Mango, for help. They set off on an adventure together.

They searched high and low, peeking behind bushes and under trees, but the kite was nowhere to be found. Just when they were about to give up, Baba spotted a glimmer of color stuck in a tall tree.

With a clever plan and teamwork, they managed to rescue the kite from the branches. Baba's face lit up with joy as she held her precious kite once more.
