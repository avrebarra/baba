Once upon a time, in a lush meadow filled with colorful flowers and buzzing bees, there lived a busy bee named Buzz and a forgetful ant named Andy.

One sunny day, while Buzz was collecting nectar for the hive, he spotted Andy struggling with carrying food to his anthill.

"Hello there! It looks like you could use some help," Buzz buzzed cheerfully.

"Oh, thank you, kind bee! I keep forgetting where I left the food," Andy replied with a smile.

Buzz decided to lend a helping wing to Andy by guiding him to his lost food trail. Together, they found the missing food and brought it safely to the anthill.

From that day on, Buzz and Andy became the best of friends, always helping each other in times of need.
