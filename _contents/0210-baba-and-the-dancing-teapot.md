One sunny morning, Baba discovered a teapot in her kitchen that could dance around on its tiny spout. "Wow! How did you learn to dance?" Baba giggled with wonder.

The teapot danced faster and faster, twirling and spinning, bumping into cups and plates. Baba's mama frowned, "Oh dear, the teapot is causing a mess!"

Baba tried to catch the teapot, but it kept dancing out of her reach. "Teapot, let's dance together nicely," Baba said gently, holding out her hand.

The teapot slowed down, seeing Baba's friendly smile. Together, they danced in harmony, spinning around the kitchen without knocking anything over. Baba's mama clapped in delight.
