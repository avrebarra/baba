Once upon a time, in the great jungle of Fora, there lived Maila, the helpful garden fairy. She was known for her kindness towards all creatures, big and small.

One sunny morning, Maila heard a soft cry coming from the edge of the enchanted garden. Curious, she fluttered over to find a lost baby turtle named Terry. Terry was trying to find his way back to the pond but couldn't remember the path.

"Hello, little one! I'm Maila. Can I help you find your way home?" asked Maila with a warm smile. Terry was relieved and shared his worry about finding his family.

Maila decided to guide Terry through the winding paths of the jungle, using her knowledge of the plants and creatures around them. Along the way, they encountered a playful squirrel who offered to show them a shortcut.

With patience and teamwork, Maila, Terry, and the squirrel reached the pond where Terry's family was waiting anxiously. They were overjoyed to see Terry safe and thanked Maila for her kindness.
