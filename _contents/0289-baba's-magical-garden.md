Once upon a time, in a cozy little cottage, lived Baba, a jolly and cute little girl with rosy cheeks and a twinkle in her eye. One sunny afternoon, while exploring the dusty attic, Baba stumbled upon a small box of mysterious seeds.

"Oh, what are these?" she exclaimed with excitement. "I wonder what will happen if I plant them in my garden!"

Baba carefully planted the seeds in her garden, watering them every day with love and care. Days passed, and to her surprise, colorful sprouts began to emerge from the earth.

As the plants grew taller, they bloomed into the most enchanting flowers Baba had ever seen, shining with a magical glow. But one day, a mischievous squirrel sneaked into Baba's garden and began nibbling on the flowers.

"Oh no! My flowers are in danger," cried Baba. Thinking quickly, she placed a bowl of nuts for the squirrel to feast on, diverting its attention away from the delicate blooms.

The squirrel happily feasted on the nuts and left Baba's garden unharmed. Baba learned that sometimes, kindness and clever thinking can solve even the trickiest of problems.
