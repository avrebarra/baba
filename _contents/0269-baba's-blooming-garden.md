Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a jolly and cute little girl named Baba. She loved spending time in her colorful garden, filled with bright flowers and buzzing bees.

One day, as Baba watered her plants, she noticed a tiny seedling peeking out of the soil. "Oh, what is this?" she exclaimed with wide eyes, filled with curiosity.

Baba decided to take care of the mysterious seedling, watering it every day and making sure it got enough sunlight. She patiently waited, wondering what would grow from it.

Days turned into weeks, and Baba's care for the seedling never wavered. Finally, one morning, she woke up to find a beautiful sunflower blooming proudly in her garden, towering over her with its golden petals.

"Wow, it's a sunflower!" Baba cheered, her face beaming with joy. She learned that with patience and love, even the smallest seed can grow into something breathtaking.
