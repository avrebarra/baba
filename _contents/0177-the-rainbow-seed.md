One sunny day in the forest, Rosie the squirrel found a shiny rainbow seed.

"Wow! What is this?" she exclaimed, hopping around excitedly.

Curious to see what would sprout, she planted the seed by the big oak tree.

Days passed, and Rosie watered the seed with love and patience.

One morning, she woke up to a colorful surprise - a magical rainbow plant!

"Hello, I'm Ruby, the rainbow plant. Thank you for caring for me," said the plant.

Rosie and Ruby became fast friends, exploring the forest together.
