In the great Fora jungle, Asha the dragoness was known for her magical healing powers and loving nature. One sunny day, the fireflies of the jungle approached Asha with a problem.

"Dear Asha," said the fireflies, "we have lost our way home and can't find our families. Can you help us?" Asha listened with a gentle smile and promised to find a solution.

Asha used her keen sense of smell and flying abilities to search the jungle. She found the fireflies hiding in tall grass, scared and lost. She comforted them with soothing words and led them back to their families.

The fireflies were overjoyed to be reunited with their loved ones. They thanked Asha for her kindness and felt grateful for her help. Asha reminded them that everyone gets lost sometimes, but with help and kindness, they can always find their way back.
