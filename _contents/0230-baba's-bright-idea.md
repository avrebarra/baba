Baba was a jolly, cute, and wholesome little girl who lived in a cozy house by the meadow. One day, a bright, colorful box appeared outside her doorstep, making her curious.

"What's inside this box, Baba?" she wondered aloud. With a big smile on her face, she opened it and found a broken toy with missing parts.

Feeling sad, Baba decided to fix the toy but couldn't find the missing pieces. She sat down and pondered, "How can I make this toy whole again?"

Suddenly, she had a bright idea. She took some colorful clay and molded the missing parts to complete the toy. It was even more beautiful than before!

With a sense of accomplishment, Baba realized that thinking creatively and finding new solutions can help solve problems in unexpected ways.
