Baba examined the map closely, intrigued by the colorful drawings of landmarks like a big oak tree and a sparkling pond. "I wonder what treasure awaits me," she said to herself with a smile.

Setting off on her adventure, Baba skipped and hopped through the forest, following the clues on the map. Along the way, she faced a big obstacleâ€”an enormous boulder blocking her path.

Baba furrowed her brow, thinking hard about how to overcome the obstacle. Suddenly, she remembered a story about teamwork her grandmother had told her. She called out, "Is anyone there to help me move this big rock?"

To Baba's surprise, a group of cheerful woodland creatures appeared, ready to lend a hand. Together, they pushed and pulled the boulder aside, clearing the way for Baba to continue her journey.

As Baba reached the final destination marked on the map, she found not a chest of gold coins, but a beautiful meadow filled with vibrant flowers and fluttering butterflies. She realized that the real treasure was the beauty of nature and the friends she had made along the way.
