In the heart of the Great Fora Jungle, nestled among ancient trees and vibrant flowers, lived Nuri, a playful forest spirit who loved exploring. One afternoon, as the sun cast golden rays through the leaves, Nuri noticed a mysterious glow coming from a hidden path.

"Oh, what's that sparkling light? It's so pretty!" Nuri exclaimed, darting towards the glow with curiosity swirling in the forest spirit's mind. Following the faint light deeper into the forest, Nuri stumbled upon a shy firefly struggling to find its way home.

"Hello, little firefly! Are you lost?" Nuri asked, eyes filled with gentle concern. The firefly explained how it had strayed too far from its family, feeling scared and alone in the darkening woods.

Determined to help, Nuri used their magical powers to illuminate the path, guiding the firefly back to its glowing family. The forest sparkled with gratitude as the fireflies danced in the night, their lights twinkling like tiny stars.
