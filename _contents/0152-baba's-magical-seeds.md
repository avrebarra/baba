Baba's eyes sparkled with wonder as she found colorful seeds scattered among the flowers in her backyard. "Wow, these are so pretty! I wonder what they will grow into," she exclaimed.

Curiosity bubbling inside her, Baba carefully planted the seeds in a row and watered them every day. To her surprise, the seeds sprouted into a beautiful garden with flowers in all colors of the rainbow.

The next day, Baba's friends came over to play. They marveled at the magical garden and asked, "Can we have some seeds to plant in our own gardens?"

Baba smiled and happily shared the rainbow-colored seeds with her friends. Together, they each planted a seed and watched as their own gardens blossomed into a dazzling display of colors.

As the sun set, Baba and her friends danced around the magical garden, feeling grateful for the joy they had shared. The rainbow garden reminded them that sharing brings happiness to everyone.
