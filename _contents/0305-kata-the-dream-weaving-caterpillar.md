In the great Fora jungle, there lived a colorful caterpillar named Kata. Kata was known for its magical ability to weave dreams for all the forest creatures. Every morning, the jungle woke up to the beautiful dreams crafted by Kata, making everyone happy.

One day, a grumpy tortoise named Timo wandered into the jungle, feeling sad and lost. Timo had never seen such bright and cheerful surroundings before. Curious, Timo approached Kata, who greeted him warmly.

"Hello, Timo! Why do you look so downcast?" asked Kata, its gentle voice soothing Timo's troubled heart. Timo explained how he missed his old home and friends. Kata listened attentively and then surprised Timo with a dream of his old friends visiting him in the jungle.

Through Kata's creativity and kindness, Timo's heart was filled with joy. He thanked Kata and left the jungle with a smile, carrying the dream in his heart. From that day on, Kata and Timo became good friends, and the aura of happiness in the jungle grew stronger.
