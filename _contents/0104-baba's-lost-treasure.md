One sunny morning, as Baba was playing in her backyard, she stumbled upon a crumpled old map hidden beneath a bush. Curious, she unfolded it and saw colorful lines and strange symbols.

"What's this, Baba?" she wondered aloud. Just then, her cat Tippy appeared, meowing eagerly. "Do you want to help me decipher this map, Tippy?" Baba asked with a smile.

Together, Baba and Tippy followed the map's twists and turns through the garden, under the oak tree, and around the pond. Finally, they reached a spot marked with a big red 'X.'

"Look, Tippy! It's a treasure chest!" Baba exclaimed, full of excitement. But as she reached for the chest, a mischievous squirrel leaped down from a branch and grabbed the treasure, scurrying away.

Baba was disappointed but remembered the joy of the adventure with Tippy. She laughed and said, "The real treasure was the fun we had together, right Tippy?" Tippy purred in agreement, and they headed back home, happy and content.
