In the forest, the wise squirrel and the silly rabbit were the best of friends. One sunny day, they found a huge apple near the river.

The problem arose when they both wanted the apple. The silly rabbit wanted to eat it all, but the wise squirrel suggested sharing it.

They couldn't agree and started arguing. The wise squirrel then came up with a brilliant idea - a race to the top of the tallest tree to decide who gets the apple.

The squirrel, being swift and agile, reached the top first. But instead of claiming the apple, she shared it with the rabbit, teaching him the value of teamwork and compromise.
