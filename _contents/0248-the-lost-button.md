One day, Baba was playing in her colorful room when she suddenly realized that the blue button from her sparkly jacket was missing.

"Oh no! My button is gone," exclaimed Baba with a worried expression. She searched high and low, under the bed and in her toy chest, but the button was nowhere to be found.

Baba decided to ask her wise grandmother for help. "Nana, I've lost my button. Can you help me find it?" she asked with a hopeful look.

Nana smiled and said, "Let's retrace your steps, dear." Together, they went to the garden, the kitchen, and even the laundry room, looking for the missing button.

Finally, after a thorough search, Nana spotted the shiny blue button in the flower bed. "Here it is, Baba! It must have fallen off when you were playing outside," Nana said with a grin.

Baba was overjoyed and hugged her grandmother tightly. "Thank you, Nana! I'm so happy we found my button together."
