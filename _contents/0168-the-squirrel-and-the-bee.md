Once upon a time in a colorful forest, a lively squirrel named Sammy loved exploring and playing all day long.

One sunny day, while Sammy was hopping from tree to tree, he saw a busy bee named Buzz buzzing around collecting flower nectar.

"Hey, Buzz! Do you want to play with me?" called Sammy, bouncing excitedly.

"Sorry, Sammy, I'm busy collecting nectar for our hive," replied Buzz apologetically.

Sammy felt a bit sad because Buzz seemed too busy to play. He sat on a tree stump, feeling lonely.

Suddenly, a flower nearby started wilting, and Buzz couldn't reach it. Sammy quickly picked the flower and held it towards Buzz.

"Thank you, Sammy! You helped me save the flower," said Buzz gratefully.

From that day on, Sammy understood the importance of Buzz's work and they became good friends, sharing adventures in the forest.
