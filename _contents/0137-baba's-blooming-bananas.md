Baba woke up to find her bananas looking bluer than the sky. "Oh my, what happened to my bananas?" she exclaimed.

Puzzled, Baba decided to ask her wise grandmother for help. "Grandma, my bananas are blue! Why did this happen?" she inquired.

Grandma chuckled and replied, "Sometimes, nature surprises us with magical moments. Embrace the uniqueness, my dear."

Determined to unravel the mystery, Baba placed the blue bananas under the shimmering sunlight. Gradually, they began to turn back to their familiar yellow hue.

As the bananas bloomed back to yellow, Baba learned that change can be beautiful and unexpected. She shared her newfound wisdom with her friends, spreading joy and curiosity among them.
