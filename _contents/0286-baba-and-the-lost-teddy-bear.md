One day, Baba was playing in her garden when she found a fluffy teddy bear peeking out from behind a bush. It had sparkly eyes and a rainbow-colored bow on its neck. Baba hugged the teddy bear tightly and decided to call it Sparkle.

Baba carried Sparkle everywhere she went, playing tea parties and bedtime stories. But one day, as she was playing, she realized Sparkle was missing! She searched high and low, but couldn't find the teddy bear anywhere.

Feeling worried, Baba asked her friend, Mr. Squirrel, if he had seen Sparkle. Mr. Squirrel remembered finding Sparkle near the treehouse and agreed to help look for it. Together, they searched the garden, peeking behind bushes and under flower pots.

Finally, they found Sparkle tangled in a bush near the treehouse. Baba was overjoyed and thanked Mr. Squirrel for his help. She learned that it's okay to ask for help when things are lost and that friends are always there to lend a hand.
