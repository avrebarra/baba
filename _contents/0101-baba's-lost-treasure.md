One sunny day, Baba was playing in her backyard when she stumbled upon a crinkled map. "Oooh, treasure map!" she exclaimed with excitement.

With a sense of adventure, Baba followed the map's twists and turns through the garden, around the pond, and into the old oak tree's shade.

Suddenly, Baba realized she was lost and couldn't find her way back home. "Oh no, where am I?" she cried, feeling scared and alone.

Just then, Baba heard her cat's familiar meow. She followed the sound and found her way back to her cozy home, where her family was waiting worriedly.

"Baba, where did you go? We missed you!" her parents said, relieved to see her safe. Baba hugged them tight, realizing that their love and care were the true treasures in her life.
