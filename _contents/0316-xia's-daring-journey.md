One sunny morning, Xia was playing with her friends near the edge of the jungle when they heard a loud roar. "What was that?" asked Xia, her ears perked up in alarm.

Her friends trembled in fear, but Xia bravely stepped forward. "I'll go check it out," she declared, her heart pounding with anticipation.

As Xia ventured deeper into the jungle, she encountered a large tiger stuck in a thorny bush. "Help me, please!" cried the tiger, looking scared and helpless.

Xia's swift feet danced around the thorns, and with a clever twist, she freed the tiger from the bush. "Thank you, Xia! You're truly brave and kind," said the tiger gratefully.

With a relieved smile, Xia returned to her friends, who were amazed by her courage. "How did you do it, Xia?" they asked, admiration gleaming in their eyes.
