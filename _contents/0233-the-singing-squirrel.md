In the heart of the Enchanted Forest lived a tiny squirrel named Nutmeg. She had a special gift - a voice that could make flowers bloom and birds dance.

One day, a wicked witch cursed the forest, silencing all its inhabitants. Trees wilted, and animals lost their joy. Nutmeg knew she had to do something.

Determined to lift the curse, Nutmeg embarked on a musical journey. She sang to the wilted flowers, whispered melodies to the sad animals, and filled the air with her enchanting tunes.

Despite facing obstacles like roaring thunderstorms and growling bears, Nutmeg's kindness and bravery shone bright. With every note she sang, the curse weakened until it finally broke.

The forest burst back to life, vibrant and cheerful as ever. The animals gathered around Nutmeg, thanking her for bringing back the music of nature.
