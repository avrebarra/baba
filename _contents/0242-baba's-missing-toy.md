One sunny morning, Baba was playing with her favorite toy, a colorful ball, in the backyard. She bounced it high up in the air and caught it with a big smile on her face.

Suddenly, Baba realized her ball was missing! "Oh no, where did my ball go?" she asked worriedly. She searched high and low, under the bushes and behind the trees, but the ball was nowhere to be seen.

Baba felt sad and sat down on the swing, thinking hard. Then she remembered that she had left her ball on the kitchen table when she went to get a snack earlier that morning.

She hurried to the kitchen and found her ball right where she left it. Baba giggled with delight, "I found you, silly ball!"

Baba learned an important lesson that day â€“ to always put her things back where they belong, so she wouldn't lose them again.
