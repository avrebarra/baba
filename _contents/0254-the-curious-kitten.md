Once upon a time, in a cozy little village, there lived a curious kitten named Kitty. Kitty's fluffy fur was as white as snow, and her big green eyes sparkled with wonder.

One day, Kitty saw a colorful butterfly flutter by and decided to follow it. She chased the butterfly through the meadow, over rocks, and under bushes, until she found herself at the edge of the village near a big tree.

As Kitty explored the tree, she spotted a group of cats playing together. She watched them from afar, feeling nervous and shy. "I wish I could join them," Kitty thought, but fear held her back.

Just then, the butterfly landed on Kitty's nose and tickled her. Giggling, Kitty made a decision. With newfound courage, she approached the other cats and introduced herself. To her surprise, they welcomed her with open paws and soon became friends.
