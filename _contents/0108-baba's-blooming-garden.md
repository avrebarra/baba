One sunny morning, Baba woke up excited to see her flowers bloom in the garden. But to her surprise, the flowers looked droopy and sad. "Oh no, why are my flowers not blooming?" Baba wondered out loud.

Baba asked her wise grandma for help. "Patience and care, my dear. Just like the sun and rain help the flowers grow, your love and gentle touch will help them bloom," Grandma said with a smile.

Determined to make her garden beautiful again, Baba watered the flowers every day, sang sweet songs to them, and even shared her snacks with them. She watched them closely, waiting for signs of growth.

Days passed, and Baba's flowers started to show signs of life. Slowly but surely, they began to bloom in vibrant colors, filling the garden with beauty. Baba danced with joy, thankful for the patience and care she showed her flowers.
