One sunny morning, Baba was getting ready for a picnic in the park with her friends.

As she was buttoning up her red coat, she realized that her favorite shiny button was missing!

"Oh no!" Baba exclaimed. "Where could my button have gone?"

She searched high and low in her room, under the bed, and even in the toy box, but the button was nowhere to be found.

Baba started to feel sad, but then she remembered what her mama always said - "Take a deep breath and think carefully, Baba."

So, Baba closed her eyes and thought hard. Suddenly, she remembered seeing the button fall off her coat near the flower garden outside.

With new determination, Baba rushed outside and found her shiny button sparkling among the colorful flowers.

"Hooray!" Baba shouted with joy. She happily sewed the button back on her coat and skipped off to the picnic.
