Once upon a time, in the great Fora jungle, there lived a kind-hearted dragoness named Asha. She was known far and wide for her extraordinary healing abilities and compassionate nature.

One sunny day, a little squirrel named Pip hurt his paw while playing in the forest. Tears welled up in his eyes as he hopped towards Asha's cave, seeking her help. "Oh dear, what happened, little one?" Asha asked in a soothing voice.

With gentle care, Asha cleaned and bandaged Pip's paw, making sure he felt comforted and safe. "Thank you, Asha," Pip said with a smile, feeling much better. "I will be more careful next time."

Asha gently patted Pip on the head and reminded him to always look out for others too. "Remember, kindness spreads like sunshine in the forest," she said, as Pip nodded in understanding. With a grateful heart, Pip scurried off into the trees, knowing that Asha's words would stay with him forever.
