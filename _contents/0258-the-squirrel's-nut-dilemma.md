One sunny day in the forest, Sammy the Squirrel found the biggest, shiniest nut he had ever seen. "Wow, this nut is all mine!" he squealed with joy.

As Sammy happily nibbled on his nut, he heard a tiny voice behind him. It was Lila the Ladybug, looking at the nut with hungry eyes. "Can I have a bite, please?" she asked shyly.

Sammy's heart sank. He wanted to help his friend, but he also didn't want to give up his special nut. Confused, he thought for a moment before coming up with a solution.

"I have an idea, Lila!" Sammy chirped. "Let's crack the nut open together, and we can share it!" Lila's face lit up with joy, and together they cracked open the nut, each enjoying half.

Sammy realized that sharing his treasure made him even happier than having it all to himself. From that day on, he and Lila shared nuts and great adventures in the forest.
