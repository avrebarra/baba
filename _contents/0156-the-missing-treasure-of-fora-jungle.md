In the heart of Fora Jungle, Nisha and Kavia, two clever wandering merchant girls, discovered a mysterious pirate ship stuck in the vines. "Look, Kavia! There's someone on the ship!" Nisha whispered, pointing towards Surya, a spirited time leaping pirate.

Surya explained that she had lost her precious treasure map and needed help to find it to sail through time. Nisha and Kavia decided to assist her, eager for an adventure. They searched high and low, encountering tricky puzzles and hidden traps along the way.

With teamwork and quick thinking, Nisha, Kavia, and Surya finally found the treasure map tucked in a tree hollow. Excited, they followed the clues to a secret cave where the long-lost treasure glittered in the dim light. They cheered and shared the treasure with Surya, who thanked them for their help.
