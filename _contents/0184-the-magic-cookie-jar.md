Once upon a time, in a cozy little cottage, Baba stumbled upon a magic cookie jar. Every time she took a cookie, the jar refilled itself with more delicious treats. Baba was delighted by this enchanting surprise!

"Wow, this cookie jar is amazing!" exclaimed Baba, munching on a chocolate chip cookie. She decided to keep this magical discovery to herself, enjoying endless supply of cookies all day long.

One sunny afternoon, Baba's friend Lilly came over to play. Baba wanted to impress Lilly with the never-ending cookies. As they played, Baba sneakily hid the cookie jar so Lilly wouldn't notice its magic.

"Baba, can I have a cookie? They smell so good!" asked Lilly with hungry eyes. Baba hesitated, not wanting to reveal her secret. But then she remembered the joy of sharing and honesty.

With a big smile, Baba showed Lilly the magic cookie jar. From that day on, they both shared the cookies and the joy of having a magical treat together, making every moment extra sweet.
