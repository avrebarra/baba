Once in a lush garden, there lived a tiny caterpillar named Ruby. Ruby was unlike other caterpillars - instead of green, she shimmered in brilliant red and gold.

One day, a group of caterpillars teased Ruby for being different. "You don't belong here with your weird colors!" they laughed.

Feeling sad and lonely, Ruby decided to seek advice from wise Old Oak Tree. The tree gently said, "Dear Ruby, your uniqueness is a gift. Embrace it and stay true to who you are."

Encouraged by the wise words, Ruby proudly showed off her dazzling colors. To her surprise, the other caterpillars were amazed by her beauty and apologized for being mean.

From that day on, Ruby and the other caterpillars became good friends, learning to appreciate each other's differences and realizing that being unique is truly special.
