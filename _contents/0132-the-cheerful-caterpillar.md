In a sunny meadow, Clara the caterpillar danced from leaf to leaf, spreading joy with her colorful stripes. She loved to greet all the animals with a friendly "Hello!"

One day, Clara met Percy the snail, who slithered by with a grumpy face. "Hello, Percy! Why the long face?" Clara asked, curious.

"Nobody wants to play with me because I'm slow," mumbled Percy. Clara's heart sank, but she had an idea.

Clara invited Percy to a leaf picnic with the other insects. Percy was hesitant at first, but couldn't resist the delicious treats and laughter.

Everyone danced and played together, with Percy's grumpy face turning into a big smile. From that day on, Percy and Clara were inseparable friends.
