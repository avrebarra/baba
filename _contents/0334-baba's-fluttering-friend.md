One sunny morning, Baba spotted a flash of colors dancing in her garden. "Wow, what's that?" she wondered aloud.

As she tiptoed closer, she saw a delicate butterfly resting on a blooming flower. "Hello, little friend," Baba greeted with a smile.

The butterfly fluttered away, making Baba sad. "Come back, I won't harm you," she called out gently.

Determined, Baba fetched a jar of sweet nectar and placed it near the flowers. She waited patiently, hoping her fluttering friend would return.

After some time, the butterfly cautiously flew back, drawn by the inviting scent of nectar. Baba's kindness had won its trust.

Slowly, the butterfly landed on Baba's outstretched hand, tickling her with its delicate wings. "We can be friends," Baba giggled happily.
