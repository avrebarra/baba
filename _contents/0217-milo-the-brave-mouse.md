In the great Fora jungle, lived Milo, a small mouse with a big heart. One day, Milo heard stories about the wise and kind King of the Forest. Curiosity bubbled inside him.

Determined to meet the King, Milo ventured into the deep jungle. Along the way, he faced challenges like crossing a fast-flowing river and climbing a tall tree.

Finally, Milo reached the majestic tree where the King lived. Nervous but brave, he squeaked, "Your Majesty, I've come to learn from you."

The King smiled, impressed by Milo's courage. He taught Milo that bravery is not about size but about facing your fears with a brave heart. Milo left feeling more confident and proud.
