One day, after a big rain, Baba and her friends were sad because they couldn't play outside. The ground was all muddy, and they didn't want to get their shoes dirty.

Baba had an idea. "Let's work together to solve this problem! If we find a way to stay clean while playing outside, we can have fun again," she said.

They gathered some old sheets and laid them down on the grass. Then they took off their shoes and ran around on the sheets, pretending they were walking on clouds.

Baba and her friends laughed and played together, enjoying the fresh air and the feeling of the wet grass under their feet. They realized that by cooperating and thinking creatively, they could still have fun even when faced with a messy situation.
