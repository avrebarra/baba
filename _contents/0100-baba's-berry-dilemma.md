One sunny morning, Baba skipped merrily in the garden, her tiny hands searching for adventure. Amidst the green leaves, she discovered a bush full of plump, shiny berries.

"Wow, these berries are so colorful and juicy! I want to take them all home," Baba exclaimed, her eyes wide with excitement. But then she remembered her friend Bunny who loves berries too.

Baba wondered, "Should I keep all the berries for myself or should I share them with Bunny?" She knew sharing was kind, but she also really wanted all the delicious berries for herself.

Suddenly, a gentle breeze whispered through the garden, reminding Baba of the joy she felt when she shared toys with Bunny before. In that moment, she made a decision that would warm Bunny's heart.

With a smile, Baba carefully picked the ripest berries and placed them in a small basket. She skipped to Bunny's house and shared her berry treasure, creating a moment of happiness and togetherness.
