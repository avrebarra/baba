Once upon a time, there was a jolly cute little girl named Baba who lived in a cozy little house with a big garden. Behind her home, there was a tall fence that she was always curious about.

One sunny day, Baba decided to sneak into the hidden garden behind the fence. She discovered a magical place filled with colorful flowers and buzzing bees. Baba was amazed by the beauty surrounding her.

Suddenly, she heard a soft voice saying, "Who dares enter my garden?" Baba turned around to see a tiny gnome peeking out from behind a bush. The gnome explained that the garden was enchanted, and only those with pure hearts could enter.

Baba felt a mix of wonder and fear, but she bravely asked the gnome if she could stay and explore. The gnome smiled and granted her permission, impressed by her courage and kind heart.

Baba spent the whole day playing with the enchanted creatures in the garden, making new friends and learning new things. As the sun set, Baba knew it was time to go home, but she promised to visit again with permission.
