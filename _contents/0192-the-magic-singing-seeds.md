One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her colorful garden when she noticed a shiny box hidden behind the flowers. "What's this?" she wondered with wide eyes.

She opened the box and found tiny seeds that shimmered in the sunlight. Curious, she planted them in the soft soil, hoping they would grow into something special.

Days passed, and Baba watered the seeds every morning, singing cheerful songs to them. One evening, she heard a faint melody coming from the ground.

"Hello, Baba! We are the magic singing seeds," a chorus of tiny voices chirped. Baba danced with delight as the seeds bloomed into beautiful flowers that sang to her.

The next day, Baba shared the magic with her friends, spreading joy and music throughout the neighborhood. The once plain street was now filled with laughter and songs.
