One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her backyard when she spotted something shiny under a bush. Curious, she crawled closer to investigate. "What is this?" Baba wondered out loud.

The sparkle turned out to be a tiny key, unlike any she had seen before. Excited, Baba tried to open the old wooden chest in the corner, hoping to uncover a secret treasure. But the key didn't fit.

Frustrated, Baba decided to seek help. She went to her neighbor, Mr. Owl, known for his wisdom. "Can you help me unlock the mystery chest, Mr. Owl?" Baba asked with hopeful eyes.

Mr. Owl examined the key and the chest, then suggested, "Let's try turning the key upside down." Baba did as he said, and to her amazement, the chest popped open, revealing a collection of colorful marbles.

Baba's face lit up with joy. She realized that the real treasure was the spark of curiosity and the willingness to seek help. Grateful, she thanked Mr. Owl for his guidance.
