Once upon a time, in the enchanting Moonlight Forest, lived Lily the Bunny and her friends, Henry the Squirrel and Mia the Hedgehog.

One sunny day, they discovered that their friend, Sam the Owl, had lost his favorite shiny feather. Sam was very sad and couldn't sleep without it.

Lily suggested, "Let's search together! The forest is big, but with teamwork, we can find it quicker." Henry and Mia agreed, hopping and scurrying around to look.

As the friends searched high and low, Mia spotted something shiny near a tall oak tree. It was Sam's lost feather caught in the branches! The friends cheered and returned the feather to a grateful Sam.

Sam thanked Lily, Henry, and Mia for their help, realizing that together, they could solve any problem that came their way.
