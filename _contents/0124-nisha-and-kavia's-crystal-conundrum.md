Nisha and Kavia, clever wandering merchant girls, were venturing through the dense Great Fora jungle when they spotted a peculiar glow shining through the trees. "Look, Kavia! What are those sparkling crystals?" Nisha exclaimed, her eyes wide with curiosity.

As they approached, a mischievous voice whispered, "Those crystals are mine, for they hold the secrets of the shadows." Startled, the girls turned to see Kai, a mysterious shadow-dwelling imp, standing before them with a mischievous grin.

Kai challenged the girls to solve a riddle in order to claim the crystals. Working together, Nisha and Kavia used their quick wits to decipher the riddle, unlocking the secrets of the glowing crystals hidden in the heart of the jungle.

With the crystals in hand, the girls bid farewell to Kai, who vanished into the shadows with a chuckle. As they continued their journey, Nisha and Kavia shared a smile, knowing that their teamwork and clever thinking had led them to a new discovery.
