In the magical Fora jungle, lived Maila, the kind and helpful garden fairy. One sunny morning, she noticed her favorite sunflower seed had gone missing! "Oh no, where could it be?" she wondered out loud.

Maila flew around the garden, asking the butterflies, bees, and birds if they had seen her precious seed. But no one had seen it. Feeling worried, she decided to sit under a blooming rose bush to think.

Suddenly, Maila remembered planting the seed near a birdbath. She flew over and there it was, the lost sunflower seed! But a curious squirrel was about to snack on it. "Stop, Mr. Squirrel! That seed belongs to my sunflower," she pleaded.

The squirrel paused and listened, then realized his mistake. He handed the seed back to Maila with an apologetic smile. Maila thanked him and planted the seed again, with a sprinkle of magic dust for good luck.
