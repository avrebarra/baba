One sunny morning, Baba was searching for her favorite toy in the attic when she stumbled upon a dusty old map. Curious, she studied it closely.

"What is this? A treasure map?" Baba wondered aloud. She decided to follow the map's twists and turns, hoping to find a hidden treasure.

As Baba journeyed through the house, the map led her to familiar places like the garden and the kitchen. But she couldn't find any treasure!

Just when she was about to give up, Baba realized that the real treasure was the memories she made while searching. She found joy in exploring her home in a new way.
