One sunny morning, Baba found a secret pouch of glittering seeds hidden in her garden shed. "Oh, whatâ€™s this?" she wondered.

"I'll plant these mysterious seeds and see what grows!" exclaimed Baba with excitement. So she carefully planted them in her flower bed.

Days passed, and Baba watered the seeds every morning with love and care. Soon, tiny colorful sprouts began peeking out of the soil.

"Oh my goodness! These are magic seeds!" Baba gasped in amazement. Each sprout blossomed into flowers that sparkled under the sun.

As the flowers bloomed, Baba noticed the air filled with a sweet, enchanting fragrance that brought joy to everyone in the neighborhood.

"Thank you for sharing these beautiful flowers!" said Baba's neighbors, feeling grateful for the magical gift.

Baba's garden became a wondrous sight, attracting butterflies and bees, spreading happiness all around.
