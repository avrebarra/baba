Washa sat by the river, playing his flute to calm the restless serpents of the jungle. Suddenly, he heard a loud hissing noise.

"What's wrong?" Washa asked, noticing a large serpent with a thorn stuck in its tail. "Please help me, Washa. It hurts," the serpent whimpered.

Without hesitation, Washa carefully removed the thorn, soothing the serpent's pain. "Thank you, Washa. I misjudged you," the serpent said, surprised by Washa's kindness.

The next day, the serpent returned with more of its kind, seeking Washa's help. "We are sorry for scaring you before. Will you still help us?"
