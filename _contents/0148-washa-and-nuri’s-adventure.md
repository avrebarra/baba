In the depths of the great Fora jungle, Washa the wise serpent charmer and Nuri the mischievous forest spirit lived harmoniously. One sunny morning, Nuri decided to play a prank on Washa by hiding his precious flute. Washa arrived at his usual spot to play soothing melodies, only to find his flute missing.

"Oh no! Where is my flute?" cried Washa, looking around in confusion. Nuri peeked from behind a tree, unable to contain a mischievous giggle. Washa frowned, realizing Nuri’s involvement. Sensing Washa’s distress, Nuri felt guilty for causing trouble.

"I'm sorry, Washa. I wanted to play a prank, but I didn't mean to upset you," Nuri confessed, hanging their head low. Washa smiled patiently, "It's important to communicate and understand each other's feelings. Let's work together to find a solution." Washa and Nuri then embarked on a joyful treasure hunt around the jungle.
