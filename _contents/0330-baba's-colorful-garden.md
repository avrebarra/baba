One sunny morning, Baba went to her garden to water her plants. She noticed that the garden looked sad and plain with only green leaves everywhere.

"Why is our garden not colorful like in the storybooks, Mama?" Baba asked, her eyes wide with curiosity.

Mama smiled and replied, "Baba, we can make our garden beautiful by planting colorful flowers. Let's go buy some seeds together!"

So, Baba and Mama went to the market and bought seeds of different colors - red, blue, yellow, and purple. They planted the seeds in the garden and watered them every day.

Days passed, and Baba's garden started blooming with vibrant flowers of all colors. Baba was delighted to see butterflies and bees buzzing around the colorful flowers.
