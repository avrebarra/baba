One sunny morning, Xia the swift-footed mountain goat decided to explore the dense Fora jungle. She had heard tales of hidden treasures and secret paths hidden deep within the trees.

As Xia ventured farther into the jungle, she came across a sleepy sloth named Luna. Luna was stuck in a tricky situation â€“ a branch had fallen on her favorite resting spot, blocking her way back to her cozy tree.

"Hello, Luna! Let me help you!" exclaimed Xia, using her strong horns to lift the branch aside. Luna blinked in surprise, grateful for Xia's kindness. Together, they shared stories of their own adventures in the jungle.

As the sun began to set, Xia realized she had lost track of time. Luna offered her a safe place to spend the night, and Xia gratefully accepted. The two newfound friends fell asleep under the twinkling stars, their hearts full of joy from their unexpected encounter.
