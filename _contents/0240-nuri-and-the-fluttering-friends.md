In the lush Fora jungle, Nuri the mischievous forest spirit loved to play tricks on the animals. One sunny day, while jumping from tree to tree, Nuri accidentally knocked over a bee hive, causing the bees to scatter and the butterflies to flutter in fright.

"Oh no, I've made the fluttering friends upset," Nuri exclaimed, feeling guilty. He knew he had to make things right. Nuri approached the bees and butterflies, apologizing for his mistake and offering to help them rebuild their homes.

Despite their initial fear, the bees and butterflies saw Nuri's sincerity and forgave him. They thanked Nuri for his help and invited him to join in their joyful dance among the colorful flowers, bringing a smile to Nuri's face.
