In the cozy forest, Sammy the Squirrel spent days collecting nuts for winter. He was so proud of his big pile of shiny nuts, he danced around it every evening.

One day, Sammy woke up to find his nuts were gone! Panic-stricken, he looked around and saw his friend, Rosie the Rabbit, gobbling up his nuts happily.

"Rosie, why did you take my nuts?" Sammy asked sadly.

"I saw you had so many nuts, and I wanted some too. I thought you wouldn't mind," Rosie replied shyly.

Sammy took a deep breath and explained that it's important to ask before taking things. He shared some nuts with Rosie, and they both had a nutty feast together.
