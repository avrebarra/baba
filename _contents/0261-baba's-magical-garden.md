One sunny morning, Baba discovered a tiny envelope near her favorite apple tree. Inside were colorful seeds with a note that said, "Plant these and see magic happen!"

Excited, Baba grabbed her tiny shovel and carefully planted the seeds in her garden. She watered them every day, waiting for something amazing to sprout.

Days went by, and tiny green shoots emerged from the soil. Baba watched in awe as the plants grew taller and blossomed into the most beautiful flowers she had ever seen.

Just as she was marveling at the magical garden, a mischievous rabbit hopped in and nibbled on the flowers. Baba gasped, worried that her garden was ruined.

"Oh no, my flowers!" exclaimed Baba, feeling sad. But then, she remembered the note and decided to sprinkle a little more magic on the garden.

Baba sang a sweet song for the plants and danced around them. To her surprise, the flowers bloomed back even more vibrant than before, and the rabbit joined her in a joyful dance.
