One enchanting night in the great Fora jungle, Kata, the dream-weaving caterpillar, was spinning his silk under the moonlit sky. Suddenly, he heard giggles nearby. It was Jia and Rua, the mischievous moonlight pixies, fluttering around a mysterious glowing patch of berries.

"Let's taste them!" Jia said excitedly, but Kata hesitated, remembering the jungle rules. "We should always ask Wise Owl before eating unknown fruits," he reminded them gently.

Ignoring Kata's warning, Jia and Rua cheerfully gobbled up the glowberries. Soon after, they started to glow themselves, floating uncontrollably in the air! "Oh no, what happened?" they squeaked in surprise.

In a panic, Kata rushed to Wise Owl's tree and explained the situation. Wise Owl cast a gentle spell to bring Jia and Rua back to the ground, calming their glow. "Always seek guidance before venturing into the unknown," Wise Owl advised kindly.
