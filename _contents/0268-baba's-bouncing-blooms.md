One sunny morning, Baba skipped into the garden, ready to water her favorite flowers. As she poured water over the plants, she noticed something strange - the flowers were bouncing up and down, giggling with joy!

Curious, Baba asked the flowers, "Why are you bouncing?" The flowers explained that they needed extra love and care to bloom beautifully. Baba promised to help them, but she wasn't sure how.

Determined to make the flowers happy, Baba sang gentle songs to them, danced around them, and even told them funny stories. She showed them love and patience, and soon the bouncing flowers began to grow taller and brighter.

As the sun set, the garden was filled with the most magnificent blooms Baba had ever seen. The flowers no longer bounced in excitement but swayed gently in the breeze, thanking Baba for her kindness and care.
