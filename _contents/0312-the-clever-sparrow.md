Once upon a time, in a lush forest, lived a clever little sparrow named Sammy. Sammy was known for his sharp wit and clever ideas.

One day, as Sammy was flying back home with some shiny beads he found, he saw a sly fox lurking nearby. The fox had a hungry look in his eyes.

"Hey there, Sammy! What treasures do you have there?" the fox asked with a sly grin.

Thinking quickly, Sammy replied, "Oh, these are magical beads that grant wishes. But they only work for birds as bright as me."

The fox, intrigued, wanted to try the beads. Sammy tied them to the fox's tail and said, "Now close your eyes and make a wish!"

As the fox closed his eyes, Sammy flew away swiftly, leaving the fox baffled, with nothing but beads on his tail.

From that day on, the fox never dared to mess with Sammy again. And Sammy learned that quick thinking could save him from any trouble.
