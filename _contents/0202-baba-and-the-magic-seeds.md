One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her garden when she stumbled upon a pile of glowing seeds.

"Wow, what are these magical seeds?" Baba exclaimed as she picked them up carefully.

Curiosity piqued, Baba decided to plant the seeds in her little vegetable patch to see what would happen.

Days went by, and Baba watered the seeds diligently, eagerly waiting to see them sprout.

Finally, tiny sprouts began to peek through the soil, but to Baba's surprise, they weren't ordinary plants.

The sprouts grew into shimmering vines with fruits that sparkled like gems, filling the garden with radiant colors.

Baba's eyes widened in awe as she realized that the magical seeds had brought a touch of whimsy to her home.
