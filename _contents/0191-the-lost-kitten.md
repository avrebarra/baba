Mia was playing in the meadow when she heard a soft "meow" coming from behind a bush. She tiptoed closer and saw a tiny, scared kitten.

"Oh no! You must be lost," said Mia softly, picking up the kitten. "Don't worry, I'll help you find your family."

Mia asked the birds, the squirrels, and the butterflies if they had seen the kitten's family. But no one knew.

Just as Mia was starting to feel worried, a friendly rabbit hopped over and said, "I know where the kitten's family lives! Follow me!"

With the rabbit's help, Mia found the kitten's family in a cozy den under a big oak tree. They were overjoyed to see their little one safe and sound.
