Once upon a time, in the vast blue sky, there lived a small, fluffy cloud named Cotton.

Every day, Cotton watched the big, fluffy clouds play hide-and-seek and dance together in the breeze.

But Cotton was too shy to join them. "I'm too little to play with them," Cotton thought sadly.

One day, a strong wind came and blew most of the big clouds away. The sky started to look empty and sad.

Seeing this, Cotton gathered all its courage and puffed up its tiny self as much as it could.

"I may be small, but I can help too," Cotton said to itself and floated up to the sky.

With its small size, Cotton soaked up the tears of the Earth, bringing much-needed relief to the dry lands.

The big clouds returned and thanked Cotton for its help. They invited Cotton to play with them, and Cotton happily joined in.
