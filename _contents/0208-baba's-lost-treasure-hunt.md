"Baba decided to go on a treasure hunt around her house. She searched high and low, under the bed and behind the door, but couldn't find her favorite toy."

"Feeling a bit sad, Baba sat down with a frown on her face. Just then, her little brother came in, bouncing with energy. 'What's wrong, Baba?' he asked."

"'I can't find my treasure!' Baba pouted. Her brother grinned and said, 'Let's look together!' They searched together, laughing and chatting."

"Finally, they spotted the toy tucked away in a corner. Baba's eyes lit up with joy as she hugged her brother. 'Thank you for helping me,' she chirped happily."
