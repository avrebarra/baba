Once upon a time, in the heart of the enchanted forest, there lived an owl named Luna who was wide awake during the day.

Luna's night-time friends teased her, "Owls should only be awake when the moon is high and the stars twinkle!"

Determined to find out why, Luna decided to explore the forest during the day. As she flew from tree to tree, she noticed a furry squirrel hopping with joy.

"Why are you so happy?" Luna asked the squirrel. The squirrel chirped, "I discovered a hidden meadow filled with colorful flowers and sweet berries!"

Luna, filled with excitement, followed the squirrel to the meadow and was mesmerized by the beauty she had never seen before.

From that day on, Luna and the squirrel became the best of friends, exploring the wonders of the forest together.
