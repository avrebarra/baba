One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her backyard when she noticed a colorful butterfly fluttering around. The butterfly looked confused and lost, flying aimlessly in circles.

"Oh no, little butterfly, are you lost?" Baba asked, her voice filled with concern. The butterfly landed on a flower nearby, looking tired and scared.

Baba gently cupped her hands and offered them to the butterfly. "Hop on, I will help you find your way home," she said with a kind smile. The butterfly hesitated at first but then cautiously climbed onto Baba's hands.

Baba carefully carried the butterfly around the garden, asking the flowers and bees if they had seen the butterfly's home. After a while, they reached a patch of colorful flowers, and the butterfly suddenly perked up, recognizing its home.

The butterfly fluttered happily towards its home, thanking Baba with a graceful dance in the air. Baba smiled, feeling happy that she could help her tiny friend find its way back.
