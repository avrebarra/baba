In the lush Fora jungle, Kian the tiger was known for his strength and loyalty. One day, as he was strolling by a river, he heard a whimpering sound.

"What's wrong, little monkey?" Kian asked, spotting Amara, the baby monkey, trapped in a hole. "My friends ran off and left me," cried Amara.

Kian knew the mischievous monkeys did not mean harm. He called out to them, "Friends, Amara needs our help!" The monkeys returned, ashamed but apologetic.

Together, they freed Amara, who hugged Kian gratefully. Kian forgave the monkeys, showing that kindness can mend mistakes and bring everyone closer.
