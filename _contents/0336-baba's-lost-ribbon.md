One sunny morning, Baba, a jolly cute little girl, woke up with excitement to wear her favorite ribbon that matched her dress perfectly. But as she searched for it in her room, she realized it was missing!

Baba looked under her bed, in the toy box, and even in the backyard but couldn't find her precious ribbon. Feeling a bit sad, she sat on the porch, wondering where it could have gone.

Just then, she saw Mr. Owl perched on a tree nearby. Baba mustered up her courage and asked, "Mr. Owl, have you seen my ribbon? It's my favorite and I can't find it anywhere."

Mr. Owl blinked his wise eyes and said, "I haven't seen it, but Mrs. Squirrel might know. She sees everything from her nest up in the oak tree."

Following Mr. Owl's advice, Baba found Mrs. Squirrel who chirped, "Oh dear, I saw your ribbon in the garden! It got caught on a bush by the flower bed."

Excited and grateful, Baba rushed to the garden and found her ribbon fluttering in the breeze. She learned that asking for help and staying determined led her to find what she had lost.
