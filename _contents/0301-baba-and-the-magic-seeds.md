One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her backyard when she stumbled upon a small pouch filled with colorful seeds. "Wow, what are these?" she wondered, picking them up with excitement.

Baba ran to her grandma, who smiled and said, "Those are magic seeds, my dear. If you plant them with kindness, they will grow into something special."

Eager to see the magic for herself, Baba dug little holes in the soil and carefully placed the seeds in, whispering kind words to each one. She watered them every day, patiently waiting for the magic to happen.

Days passed, and Baba started to lose hope. "Grandma, why aren't the seeds growing?" she asked, feeling a bit sad. Her grandma hugged her gently and replied, "Magic takes time, dear. Keep believing."

Finally, one morning, Baba woke up to a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers blooming from the seeds. Her eyes sparkled with joy as she realized that her kindness had made the magic happen.
