One sunny morning, Baba woke up excited to tend to her magical garden. She carefully watered her colorful flowers and sang to her fluttering butterflies, spreading joy all around.

As she watered her favorite orange tree, Baba thought, "I love my tree so much, it must be thirsty." So, she poured bucket after bucket of water on its roots, thinking more water meant more love.

But, as days passed, Baba noticed her tree's leaves turning yellow and droopy. Worried, she asked the wise old owl in her garden for help.

The owl explained, "Just like too many sweets are not good for you, too much water can drown the roots of the tree, making it sad." Baba felt sad but soon realized her mistake.

She gently reduced the watering and, with patience, her tree slowly started to recover. Baba learned that sometimes giving too much love can have unexpected consequences.
