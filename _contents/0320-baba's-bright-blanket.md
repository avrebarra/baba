One sunny morning, Baba woke up with a big smile on her face. She loved her cozy, colorful blanket that she used to cuddle with every night.

But when she reached for her blanket, it was nowhere to be found! "Oh no, where did my blanket go?" Baba exclaimed, feeling a bit worried.

Baba searched high and low around the house, peeking under the bed and behind the curtains. She asked her toys, "Have you seen my blanket?" but they remained silent.

Suddenly, Baba heard a soft giggle coming from the living room. She followed the sound and found her little brother, Tim, wrapping himself in her blanket.

Instead of getting upset, Baba smiled and said, "Tim, I see you like my blanket too! How about we share it?" Tim's eyes lit up, and he agreed happily.

Baba and Tim sat together under the bright blanket, playing and laughing. They realized that sharing made both of them feel warm inside.
