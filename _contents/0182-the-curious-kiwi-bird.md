Once upon a time, in the lush forests of New Zealand, there lived a curious kiwi bird named Sammy. Sammy loved exploring the forest and hopping from tree to tree.

One day, as Sammy was hopping around, he heard a soft melody coming from a distant tree. Curiosity piqued, he decided to investigate. As he got closer, he saw a group of colorful birds singing and dancing joyfully.

Sammy was captivated by the beautiful music and joined the birds in their song. The birds welcomed him with open wings and taught him the lyrics to their melodious tune. Sammy felt a sense of belonging he had never felt before.

From that day on, Sammy visited his new friends regularly, singing and dancing with them under the canopy of the forest. His curiosity had led him to a delightful discovery and brought him new friendships that filled his heart with happiness.
