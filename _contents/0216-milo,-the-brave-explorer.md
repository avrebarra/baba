In the great Fora jungle, lived Milo, the brave little mouse. One day, as Milo was exploring near the riverbank, he heard a loud cry for help. It was the King of the forest, caught in a hunter's trap!

"Oh no, King! Don't worry, I'll save you," Milo squeaked, determined to help his friend. Using all his strength, Milo gnawed at the ropes of the trap until the King was finally free.

The King, grateful for Milo's bravery, thanked him with a promise. "Milo, you have a heart of gold. From now on, you are my honorary royal explorer. Your courage and kindness deserve to be rewarded."

Overwhelmed with joy, Milo bowed before the King, happy to have helped a friend in need. As they walked back to the royal palace together, the sun set over the Fora jungle, shining a light on their newfound friendship.
