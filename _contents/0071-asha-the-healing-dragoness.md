Once upon a time in the Great Jungle of Fora, there lived Asha, a kind and caring dragoness known far and wide for her healing powers. She was respected by all the animals for her gentle nature and willingness to help those in need.

One sunny morning, Asha heard a distressed cry echoing through the jungle. Following the sound, she found Lumi the lost firefly, surrounded by tangled vines. Lumi was trembling with fear, unable to find her way home.

"Oh dear Lumi, don't worry," reassured Asha, using her fiery breath to clear the vines. "I will guide you back home safely." With Asha's light glowing brightly, they journeyed through the jungle until Lumi's friends saw them and rejoiced.

As a token of gratitude, Lumi's friends gifted Asha with a special crystal that glowed with magical energy. The crystal would always guide Asha back whenever she needed help. The animals in the jungle cheered for Asha's kindness and friendship.
