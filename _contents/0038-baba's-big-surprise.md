Baba was sweeping her attic when she stumbled upon a dusty trunk. Curious, she opened it to find old treasures.

Among the treasures was a shiny, golden key. Baba remembered her late husband giving it to her long ago, but she forgot its purpose.

She decided to try the key in different locks around the house. At last, in the garden shed, the key clicked, and the door creaked open.

Inside, Baba found a beautiful music box. As she wound it up, sweet melodies filled the air, bringing back memories of happier times.
