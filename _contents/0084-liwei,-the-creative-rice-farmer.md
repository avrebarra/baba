In the great jungle of Fora, there lived a gentle and hardworking rice farmer named Liwei. Liwei was known for his creativity in finding solutions to problems. He had a reputation for never giving up when faced with challenges.

One day, a severe drought hit the jungle, and the rice fields began to wither. The other farmers in Fora panicked, unsure of what to do. Liwei remained calm and thought hard about how he could save the rice crops.

"I will create a series of small canals to distribute the little water we have left evenly among the fields," Liwei announced confidently. The other farmers were skeptical, but they agreed to let Liwei try his plan.

Using bamboo sticks and natural materials, Liwei constructed a network of canals that allowed the water to flow efficiently to every corner of the fields. The crops thrived, and the other farmers were amazed at how Liwei's creativity had saved their harvest.
