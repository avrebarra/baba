One sunny afternoon, Baba was playing with her favorite teddy bear when she suddenly had to go for lunch. She left her teddy bear on the sofa and ran off to eat her meal.

After lunch, Baba wanted to go back and play with her teddy bear, but she couldn't find it anywhere in the house! She searched high and low, but the teddy bear was nowhere to be seen.

Panicked, Baba asked her mom and dad for help. They all searched together, under the bed, in the closet, and even in the garden. But the teddy bear was still missing.

Just when Baba was about to give up, she remembered that she had taken her teddy bear to the backyard tea party with her toys. She rushed outside and found her teddy bear happily sitting beside a flowerpot, waiting to be invited to another tea party.
