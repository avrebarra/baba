Once upon a time in the great Fora jungle, Surya the spirited time leaping pirate was exploring when he met Nisha and Kavia, the clever wandering merchant girls duo.

"Ahoy there, Surya! What brings you to our jungle?" Nisha asked, intrigued by the pirate's shiny time-turning compass.

Surya explained how he accidentally landed in their time and needed help finding his way back.

The girls knew the jungle like the back of their hands and suggested using rare jungle gems to power Surya's compass for a time jump.

As they searched for the gems, they encountered a mischievous monkey who had hidden them high in the trees.

Working together, Surya's time leaping skills, Nisha's clever negotiating, and Kavia's quick climbing helped retrieve the gems.
