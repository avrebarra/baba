In a lush green forest, a clever turtle named Tommy lived by a sparkling pond. He loved to bask in the sun and tell stories to the other animals.

One day, a curious crow named Clara flew by and perched on a nearby branch. "Hello, Mr. Turtle! What exciting tales do you have to share today?" she asked eagerly.

Tommy smiled and invited Clara to join him. As they chatted, they heard a loud commotion near the pond. The water had dried up, and the fish were flopping helplessly on the ground!

Tommy and Clara realized that a giant beaver had built a dam that blocked the stream. "How can we help the fish?" asked Clara. Tommy had a clever ideaâ€”together, they would trick the beaver into dismantling the dam.

Clara distracted the beaver with her shiny feathers, while Tommy sneaked behind and nibbled on the sticks holding the dam. Soon, the water flowed freely again, saving the fish.
