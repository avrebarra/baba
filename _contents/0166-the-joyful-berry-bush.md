One sunny morning, Baba skipped around her garden with joy. As she watered her flowers, she noticed a small bush hidden behind the shed. "Hmm, what's there?" she wondered.

Curious Baba decided to investigate. She carefully approached the bush and peered inside. To her surprise, she found beautiful red berries glistening in the sun. "Wow!"

Baba tried to reach for the berries, but they were too high. "Oh no, how can I get them?" she exclaimed. Suddenly, a wise squirrel passing by chirped, "Patience and hard work, dear!"

Baba fetched a stool and watered the bush every day. She waited patiently as the berries ripened. Finally, after some time, she was able to pluck the delicious berries and share them with her friends. They all enjoyed the sweet reward of her hard work.
