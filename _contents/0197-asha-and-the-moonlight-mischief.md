Once upon a time, in the heart of the great Fora jungle, lived Asha, a compassionate healer dragoness. She was loved by all creatures for her gentle ways.

One night, as Asha was dozing under the twinkling stars, she heard soft giggles nearby. Opening her eyes, she saw Jia and Rua, the mischievous moonlight pixies, playing with her healing herbs.

Asha gently asked, "What are you two doing with my herbs?"

Jia and Rua looked sheepish. "We thought they were shiny treasures to play with. We are sorry."

Asha smiled kindly. "It's alright, little ones. Let me show you the magical uses of these herbs."

She taught the pixies about the healing powers of each herb, and how they could help others in need. Jia and Rua listened with wonder and promised to never disturb her herbs again.
