In the great Fora jungle, lived Milo, a brave little mouse loved by all creatures for his courage. One day, the King of the Forest, a majestic lion, got trapped in a pit while on a stroll.

"Oh no! The King needs help," exclaimed Milo when he saw the situation. He knew he had to do something. The other animals were too big and scared to jump in and help the lion out.

"I will go down the pit and try to lift the King out," declared Milo with determination. He held onto a vine and went down carefully. With all his might, Milo pushed the lion up until the King was able to climb out.

The King was grateful for Milo's bravery and quick thinking. He praised the little mouse in front of all the animals in the jungle. From that day on, Milo was known as a hero among all creatures big and small.
