In a vibrant forest, Coco the caterpillar played amongst colorful flowers and fluttering butterflies. One day, under a shiny rock, Coco discovered a small, glowing orb that hummed softly.

"What is this?" Coco asked the wise old turtle, Tito. "Oh, that is the Forest Crystal," Tito replied. "It grants wishes but be careful, it can only be used once."

Excited, Coco thought of using the crystal to fly like the butterflies. But before doing so, Coco wondered if there was a better way to help others.

Coco decided to wish for a magic flower that could bring happiness to all creatures in the forest. The Forest Crystal glowed brightly, granting the selfless wish.

The next morning, the forest was filled with the sweet scent of the magic flower, spreading joy and laughter everywhere. Coco's friends thanked the curious caterpillar for thinking of others before themselves.
