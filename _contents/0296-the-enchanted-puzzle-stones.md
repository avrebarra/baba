One sunny afternoon, Nisha and Kavia, the clever wandering merchant girls, were exploring the depths of the Great Fora jungle when they found a set of colorful puzzle stones glimmering in the sunlight.

"These stones must hold a secret," Nisha exclaimed with curiosity, while Kavia examined the intricate carvings on each piece.

Just then, Ravi, the adventurous young mapmaker, appeared from behind a tree. "I could use my mapmaking skills to help you decipher the puzzle," he suggested.

Together, the trio worked tirelessly, rearranging the stones and studying the symbols etched on them. After much trial and error, they finally unlocked the hidden message: "Unity is the key to unlocking happiness."

With a sense of accomplishment, Nisha, Kavia, and Ravi realized that by combining their unique strengths and perspectives, they could overcome any challenge that came their way.
