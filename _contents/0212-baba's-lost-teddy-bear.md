One sunny morning, Baba woke up with a big smile on her face. She loved playing with her teddy bear, who she named Fluffy. But today, Fluffy was nowhere to be found! Baba looked under the bed, in the toy box, and even in the garden, but Fluffy was still missing.

"Oh no, where did you go, Fluffy?" Baba said with a frown. Just then, her little brother giggled and pointed to the kitchen cupboard. Baba opened it and there was Fluffy, sitting on a pile of tea towels!

"Thank you, little brother! Fluffy was hiding in the cupboard all along," Baba laughed as she hugged her teddy bear tight. She learned that sometimes things are not where we expect them to be, but a little patience and help can solve the mystery.
