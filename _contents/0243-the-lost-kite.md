Lily and Sammy were excited to fly their colorful kite in the big meadow.

Suddenly, a strong gust of wind carried the kite away into the dense forest.

"Oh no, our kite is gone!" cried Lily, feeling sad.

Sammy reassured, "Don't worry, Lily! Let's find it together."

The forest was full of tall trees and chirping birds, making it a bit scary.

"I think I saw something red up high," said Lily, pointing up a tree.

Working together, Sammy climbed the tree and retrieved the kite, bringing smiles to their faces.
