Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a talking rainbow named Rosie. She loved to sing and dance in the sky, spreading colors wherever she went.

One day, a mischievous cloud appeared, blocking Rosie's path. The cloud laughed, "I'll make sure you can't shine your colors today!"

Rosie felt sad, but then she remembered her grandma's words, "Kindness is the strongest color of all." She bravely asked the cloud, "Why are you being mean?"

The cloud sighed, "I feel lonely because I don't have friends." Rosie smiled warmly, "I'll be your friend! We can make rainbows together!"

With Rosie's kindness, the cloud's gray sadness turned into fluffy white joy. Together, they painted the sky with beautiful rainbows, making everyone happy.
