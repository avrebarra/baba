Once in a lush green forest, lived a lazy grasshopper named Greg. He loved to play all day and never helped anyone.

Nearby, a group of hardworking ants toiled tirelessly to collect food for the upcoming winter. All except one ant, Annie, who was always ready to lend a hand to anyone in need.

One day, a heavy storm hit the forest, sweeping away Greg's home and food. Hungry and cold, Greg turned to Annie and the ants for help.

Grateful for Annie's kindness, Greg apologized for his laziness and offered to help the ants in return. Together, they rebuilt Greg's home and stocked up on food.

From that day on, Greg learned the joy of helping others, and the ants gained a new friend who always assisted them in times of need.
