Once upon a time, in a cozy meadow, lived a busy ant and a carefree grasshopper. The ant spent the sunny days gathering food for winter, while the grasshopper danced and sang joyfully.

One day, a storm approached, and the grasshopper realized he had no food saved. He rushed to the ant's home, "Dear ant, please help me. I have no food for the rainy days."

The ant, although tired from work, welcomed the grasshopper with kindness. Together, they stored enough food for both to survive the storm. The grasshopper learned the importance of preparation and hard work.
