In the heart of the Mongolian steppe, there lived a brave yak named Altan who was known for his fearless nature and kind heart. Among the animals, there was a cunning fox named Bayar who envied Altan's respect within the community.

One day, Bayar devised a plan to trick Altan into a dangerous situation by pretending to be in distress. Altan, being compassionate, rushed to help the fox without suspecting any foul play. As soon as Altan approached, Bayar attempted to lead him into a deep ravine nearby.

Sensing the danger, Altan stopped in his tracks and confronted Bayar about his deceitful intentions. Angered by his treachery, Altan chased Bayar away from the steppe, warning other animals about the fox's wicked ways. From that day onwards, Altan's bravery and wisdom were praised throughout the steppe.

Despite the fox's deception, Altan's courage and quick thinking saved him from a perilous fate, proving that true bravery lies in seeing through the facade of deception.
