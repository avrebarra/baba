In the forest of bright green leaves and colorful flowers, there lived a little firefly named Sparkle.

One night, while flying around, Sparkle got lost and couldn't find its way back home.

Wandering around, Sparkle met a wise owl named Hoot who offered to help. But Sparkle was too shy to accept.

Feeling sad and scared, Sparkle heard giggles from a group of playful fireflies. They had found Sparkle and welcomed it to join their glowing dance.

Sparkle's heart filled with happiness as it danced with the friendly fireflies, their lights twinkling brightly in the night sky.
