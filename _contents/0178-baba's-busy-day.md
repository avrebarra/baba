One sunny morning, Baba woke up with a big smile on her face. She wanted to help her family with the chores around the house. "I will be a big helper today!" she shouted happily.

Baba's first task was to feed the chickens in the backyard. As she sprinkled the grains, she noticed that the hen had laid a special blue egg. Curious, Baba gently picked it up and showed it to her family.

Next, Baba helped her mommy water the colorful flowers in the garden. But uh-oh, she accidentally spilled some water on her shoes. "Oopsie daisy!" Baba chuckled as she tried to dry them under the sun.

As the sun started to set, Baba realized she still had one more task left â€“ to gather firewood for the night. She ran to the woods and collected as much wood as she could carry. "I did it!" she exclaimed proudly.

Baba's family was so grateful for all her help. They thanked her for being such a wonderful helper. Baba beamed with joy, knowing that even the smallest tasks can make a big difference.
