Baba's eyes widened in excitement as she unfolded the crinkled map. "Look, Granny! A treasure map!" she exclaimed. Her grandmother chuckled and replied, "That's an old map of our backyard, dear."

Determined to find the hidden treasure, Baba grabbed a shovel and began digging at the spot marked on the map. After a while, she hit something hard. "I found it, Granny! I found it!" Baba shouted, but to her disappointment, it was just a rusty old bucket.

Disheartened, Baba sat on the ground, feeling a bit sad. "Don't worry, Baba," Granny said with a smile. "Sometimes the greatest treasures are not gold or jewels, but the memories we create while searching for them."

Encouraged by Granny's words, Baba put down the map and started playing in the garden, making up stories about the imaginary treasure. As the sun set, Baba realized that the real treasure was the fun and laughter she shared with Granny that day.
