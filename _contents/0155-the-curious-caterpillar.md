In the Enchanted Forest, Coco always wondered why the sky was so blue.

One day, she decided to ask Sammy the Owl, the wisest creature in the forest.

Sammy explained that the sky was blue because of the way the sunlight scattered in the air.

Excited by this new knowledge, Coco asked Sammy more questions about the world around her.

As she learned more, Coco made new friends with other creatures who were also curious.

Together, they explored the forest, uncovering secrets and wonders they had never seen before.
