In the vibrant forest of Oakwood, lived a playful squirrel named Sammy. He loved to skip and hop from tree to tree, spreading joy all around.

One sunny morning, Sammy noticed a tall tree with the tastiest acorns sitting on top. Determined and excited, he decided to climb up to reach them.

As Sammy climbed higher and higher, his small feet started feeling tired, and fear crept in his heart. "I can't do it!" he squeaked.

Just then, a wise old owl named Oliver fluttered by. "Believe in yourself, Sammy," said Oliver with a gentle smile. "You can do it."

Encouraged by Oliver's words, Sammy took a deep breath and continued climbing, one step at a time. Finally, he reached the top and tasted the yummiest acorns ever!
