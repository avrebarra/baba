One day, while playing in her backyard, Baba stumbled upon a shiny, bouncy ball tucked under a bush. "Wow, what's this?" she exclaimed, eyes wide with wonder.

She picked up the ball and gave it a little bounce. To her amazement, the ball bounced higher and higher with each touch. "This is so cool!" Baba giggled.

Soon, Baba's friends, Lily and Max, noticed the magical bouncy ball. "Can we play with it, Baba?" they asked eagerly.

Baba hesitated, not wanting to share her newfound treasure. But then she remembered how much fun it is to play together. "Okay, let's all play with it!" she said with a smile.

As they took turns bouncing the ball, their laughter filled the air. Baba realized that sharing the joy of the bouncy ball made the game even more fun for everyone.
