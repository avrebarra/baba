One sunny afternoon, Baba was playing in her backyard when she noticed a beautiful butterfly fluttering around her garden.

"Hello there, little butterfly! Are you lost?" Baba asked in a gentle voice.

The butterfly looked puzzled and fluttered closer to Baba, as if seeking help.

"Don't worry, I'll help you find your way home," Baba reassured the butterfly with a warm smile.

Baba carefully followed the butterfly as it guided her through the colorful flowers and tall grass.

After a short while, they reached a field filled with more butterflies dancing in the sunlight.

The lost butterfly joined its friends with a joyful dance, thanking Baba with a graceful flutter of its wings.
