One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her garden when she spotted a beautiful butterfly with vibrant wings. "Wow, look at the pretty butterfly!" she exclaimed with excitement.

The butterfly danced around the flowers, enchanting Baba with its graceful movements. "I want to catch it and keep it with me," she thought, reaching out to grab it gently.

But as Baba tried to catch the butterfly, it fluttered out of her reach, making her sad. "Where did it go?" she asked, feeling disappointed.

Baba's mother noticed her frowning and asked, "What's wrong, sweetie?" Baba replied, "I wanted to keep the butterfly, but it flew away."

Her mother smiled and said, "But butterflies are meant to be free, Baba. By releasing it, you've allowed it to spread joy to others too."

Baba's face lit up as she realized the beauty in letting go. She watched the butterfly soar into the sky, bringing a smile to her face.
