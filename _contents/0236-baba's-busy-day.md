One sunny morning, Baba was playing with her favorite toy, a shiny red ball, in the garden. Suddenly, the ball bounced off and disappeared behind the bushes. Baba looked everywhere but couldn't find it.

Baba felt sad and went inside the house to look for it. While searching, she heard her brother, Amir, humming in his room. She peeked in and saw him playing with her ball, using it as a pretend microphone!

Baba felt a mix of emotions - surprised, upset, and confused. She didn't understand why Amir took her ball. So, she approached him and asked, "Amir, why do you have my ball?"

Amir looked sheepish and explained that he thought she wouldn't mind since she had many toys. Baba smiled and gently told Amir that she loved that ball very much. Amir felt sorry and handed the ball back to Baba with an apology.
