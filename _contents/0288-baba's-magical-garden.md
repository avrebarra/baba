One morning, while playing in her backyard, Baba found a shiny seed lying on the ground. "Wow! What's this?" she exclaimed, full of curiosity. She decided to plant it in a small pot near her swing.

Days went by, but nothing seemed to happen. Baba watered the seed every day, hoping for it to grow. "Why isn't it sprouting?" she wondered, feeling a bit sad. But she didn't give up.

One fine morning, Baba woke up to a magical sight. The seed had finally bloomed into a beautiful flower with sparkling petals that glittered in the sunlight. Baba's eyes widened in amazement, and she giggled with joy.

"Look, Mama, my flower is magical!" Baba exclaimed, jumping up and down with excitement. Mama smiled, proud of Baba's patience and determination. Together, they marveled at the wondrous flower in their backyard.
