Sunny loved sharing her light with the creatures of the forest every night. But one evening, she realized her glow was fading.

Worried, Sunny flew to wise old Owl for advice. "I've lost my shine, Owl. What should I do?" she asked.

Owl listened intently and shared, "Change is a part of life, dear Sunny. You must look within yourself to find your light again."

Determined, Sunny searched her heart and remembered the joy of spreading happiness. As she embraced change with a positive attitude, her glow returned brighter than ever.
