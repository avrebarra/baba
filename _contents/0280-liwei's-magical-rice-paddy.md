In the Great Fora jungle, there lived a creative rice farmer named Liwei. He tended to his rice paddy with love and care, singing songs to his plants.

One day, a mischievous fox snuck into Liwei's paddy and dug up the rice seeds. Liwei arrived to find his hard work destroyed, feeling sad and frustrated.

"Oh no, my rice is ruined! What will I do?" Liwei exclaimed, feeling hopeless. But then he remembered his grandmother's advice: "Turn obstacles into opportunities!"

Liwei decided to plant flower seeds in place of the rice, hoping for a miracle. That night, a magical rainfall transformed the flower seeds into a mesmerizing garden.

In the morning, Liwei was astonished to see his paddy blooming with colorful flowers. The villagers came to marvel at the beauty, and Liwei's heart swelled with joy.
