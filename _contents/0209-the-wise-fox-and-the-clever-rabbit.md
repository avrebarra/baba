Once upon a time, in the Enchanted Forest, there lived a wise old fox named Finley. He loved to nap in the warm sun and share stories with his forest friends.

One day, while Finley was napping under a large oak tree, a clever rabbit named Rosie hopped by. "Excuse me, Mr. Fox," she said. "Could you help me find my way back to my burrow?"

Finley opened his eyes and smiled kindly at Rosie. "Of course, my dear. But I have a riddle for you first. Solve it, and I will lead you home," he said with a twinkle in his eye.

Rosie eagerly listened to the riddle and pondered for a moment. "The answer is the setting sun," she exclaimed with a grin.

Impressed by Rosie's quick thinking, Finley led her safely back to her burrow. From that day on, they became the best of friends, sharing many adventures and riddles in the Enchanted Forest.
