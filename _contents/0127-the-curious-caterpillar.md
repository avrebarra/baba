Once in a magical garden, a little caterpillar named Coco lived happily eating leaves all day. One night, Coco overheard the wise old owl mentioning hidden treasures in the garden.

"What treasures could be hiding in the dark?" wondered Coco. Determined to find out, Coco ventured into the garden filled with shimmering fireflies and mysterious shadows.

Along the way, Coco encountered a grumpy squirrel guarding a path to a glowing rose bush. "This is my rose bush! Go away!" grumbled the squirrel. Coco replied with kindness, offering to share the leaves from the nearby tree.

Moved by Coco's generosity, the squirrel smiled and let Coco pass. At the rose bush, Coco discovered sparkling dew drops that made the flowers shine like diamonds.
