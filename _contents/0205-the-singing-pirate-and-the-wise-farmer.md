In the great Fora jungle, Liwei the wise farmer tended to his rice fields with care and creativity. One day, while working under the hot sun, he heard a beautiful melody coming from the distant river.

Curious, Liwei followed the sound and stumbled upon Zoran, a gentle singing pirate with a voice as soothing as a lullaby. Zoran was sitting by the river, strumming his ukulele and singing songs of the sea.

"Hello there, I'm Liwei. Your singing is wonderful!" Liwei exclaimed with admiration. Zoran looked up, surprised but happy. "Thank you! I'm Zoran, a pirate who loves to sing. Would you like to hear more songs?"

As they spent the day together, Liwei showed Zoran how to plant rice creatively, using different patterns in the fields. In return, Zoran taught Liwei sea shanties and tales of his pirate adventures.

When a sudden storm approached, Zoran used his pirates' skills to help protect the rice fields from damage. Thanks to their teamwork, the crops were saved, and they celebrated with a joyful song under the rainbow.
