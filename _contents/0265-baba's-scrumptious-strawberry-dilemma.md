One sunny afternoon, Baba was strolling in her grandma's garden when she spotted a plump, shiny red strawberry glistening in the sunlight. Curiosity twinkled in her eyes as she gingerly plucked it.

"Oh, what a scrumptious strawberry!" Baba exclaimed, holding it up to the sky. Just then, her friend Lily skipped into the garden.

"Wow, Baba! That's the biggest strawberry I've ever seen! Can I have a tiny bite?" Lily asked with hopeful eyes.

Baba hesitated, torn between savoring the strawberry all by herself or sharing it with her friend. After a moment of deep thought, she smiled and broke the strawberry in half, offering a piece to Lily.

Lily's face lit up with delight as she savored the sweet berry. Baba's heart felt warm and happy seeing her friend's joy. Together, they giggled and played under the shade of the old oak tree.
