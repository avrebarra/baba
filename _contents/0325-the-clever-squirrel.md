In a dense forest, a playful squirrel named Sammy lived happily climbing trees and collecting acorns. One day, he was exploring near a berry bush when he overheard a bear grumbling about being hungry.

Sammy, wanting to help the bear without getting caught, devised a clever plan. He chattered loudly to catch the bear's attention and led him to the berry bush. The bear, excited by the sight of juicy berries, leaned in to eat.

Swift as the wind, Sammy darted up the nearby tree, causing the bear to stumble and miss the bush. The clever squirrel giggled from the treetop, safe from harm but still able to share a good laugh with the bear.
