One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her garden when she saw a bee buzzing around the flowers. "Oh no, a bee!" she exclaimed, feeling scared.

"Baba, don't be afraid of bees," said her grandmother, who was watching nearby. "Bees are important for our garden, and they won't harm you if you don't harm them."

Baba took a deep breath and decided to be brave. She slowly approached the bee and watched it collect nectar from the flowers. The bee seemed busy and uninterested in Baba.

"Look, Baba, the bee is just doing its job," her grandmother said with a smile. "They are not here to scare us."

Feeling confident, Baba sat next to the bee and observed it for a while. She saw how hardworking and gentle the bee was, and she felt proud of herself for facing her fear.

From that day on, Baba became friends with the bees in her garden and learned to appreciate their importance in nature.
