Baba was getting ready to play outside when she realized her beloved teddy bear was nowhere to be found. She searched her room and the living room, but the teddy bear seemed to have disappeared.

"Mama, where's my teddy bear?" Baba asked with a worried look on her face. Her mother suggested retracing her steps to find it.

Baba thought for a moment and remembered playing with her teddy bear in the backyard yesterday. With determination, she dashed outside to search, not giving up hope.

After some time looking behind bushes and under chairs, Baba finally spotted her teddy bear peeking out from under a pile of leaves. She let out a joyful cry and hugged it tightly.

"I found you, Teddy!" Baba exclaimed with a big smile, feeling relieved and happy to have her friend back. She learned to always keep her toys in a safe place.
