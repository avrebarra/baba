One day, on her way to explore the garden, Baba noticed a beautiful butterfly fluttering by. "Hello, little butterfly! Where are you going?" she asked with a grin.

The butterfly told Baba about a special flower in the garden that needed help. Baba's eyes sparkled with excitement. "I can help! Show me the way," she said, following the butterfly's lead.

As they reached the flower, Baba saw that it was drooping and sad. "Don't worry, little flower. I'll water you," Baba reassured. But the watering can was too heavy for her small hands.

Baba remembered her mother's advice to always ask for help when in need. She called out for her mother, who helped her water the flower. Slowly, the flower perked up and bloomed brightly.
