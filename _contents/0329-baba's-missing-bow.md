One sunny morning, Baba woke up with excitement to wear her favorite bow on her hair. But as she searched through her toys and clothes, she couldn't find it anywhere.

"Oh no, where is my pretty bow?" Baba asked her teddy bear. "I don't know, let's look together," Teddy replied, eager to help.

They searched under the bed, in the toy chest, and even in the kitchen. After lots of looking and moving things around, Baba found her bow tucked away in her backpack where she left it the day before.

"Yay! I found it!" Baba cheered, hugging Teddy tightly. "I should always keep my bow in its special place to find it easily next time."
