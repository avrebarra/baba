Once upon a time, in the heart of the Great Jungle of Fora, lived Nuri, a mischievous forest spirit known for playing pranks on the animals and plants.

One sunny morning, as Nuri was flying around, it spotted a bird struggling to build its nest. Nuri thought, "It's time for some fun!"

With a mischievous grin, Nuri fluttered down and scattered the twigs and leaves the bird had gathered. The bird chirped sadly, "Who did this?"

Feeling a pang of guilt, Nuri decided to make things right. It gathered more twigs and leaves, helping the bird finish its nest. The bird's eyes sparkled with gratitude.

From that day on, Nuri's reputation in the jungle changed. Animals and plants no longer feared its pranks, but rather welcomed its playful presence. Nuri learned that kindness brings joy to everyone.
