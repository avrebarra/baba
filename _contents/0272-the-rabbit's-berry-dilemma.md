Once upon a time, in a sunny forest, a fluffy rabbit named Rosie hopped around looking for a delicious snack.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a hidden bush full of juicy berries! Rosie's eyes sparkled with joy as she nibbled on the sweet treats.

Just then, a wise squirrel named Sammy scurried over and asked, "May I try a berry, too?"

Rosie hesitated, worried that there wouldn't be enough berries for both of them. She thought for a moment before deciding to share.

As they both enjoyed the berries together, they laughed and chatted, becoming fast friends. Rosie learned that sharing brought double the joy.
