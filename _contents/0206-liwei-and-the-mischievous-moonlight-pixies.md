In the great Fora jungle, there lived Liwei, a creative rice farmer who loved growing different varieties of rice. One starlit night, he stumbled upon two tiny creatures playing by the moonlit pond.

"Who are you?" asked Liwei, curious about the giggling pixies named Jia and Rua. The mischievous duo had been causing trouble by playing pranks on other animals in the jungle.

Sensing their loneliness, Liwei invited them to help him tend his rice paddies the next day. At first, the pixies were unsure, but Liwei's warm smile convinced them to give it a try.

Together, they worked tirelessly under the golden sun, planting and watering the rice. As they toiled side by side, their laughter filled the air, forming a bond of friendship.

When the harvest season came, the rice paddies bloomed with the most beautiful rice plants, shimmering like the stars in the night sky. Jia and Rua, touched by Liwei's kindness, apologized for their past pranks and promised to be helpful forest companions.
