In a lively forest filled with tall trees and colorful flowers, lived a kind-hearted squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved to share his acorns with his animal friends â€“ the birds, rabbits, and chipmunks.

One day, all the food in the forest disappeared! The animals were sad and hungry. Sammy noticed his acorn stash was untouched. He decided to share his acorns with everyone, even though he was worried about running out.

As Sammy shared his acorns, the other animals were touched by his generosity. The birds offered to sing cheerful songs, the rabbits hopped around joyfully, and the chipmunks danced in gratitude.

It turned out that a mischievous raccoon had hidden all the food as a prank. When the raccoon saw how happy Sammy's kindness made everyone, he felt guilty. He apologized to the animals and helped them find their hidden food.
