Once upon a time in the Great Fora jungle, there lived a creative rice farmer named Liwei. He worked hard every day to tend to his rice paddy, hoping for a bountiful harvest.

One day, Liwei noticed that his rice plants were growing slowly and looked pale. Worried, he asked his wise old neighbor, "Why are my rice plants not growing well?"

The neighbor suggested that Liwei try feeding his plants with a special brew made from the petals of rare jungle flowers. Excited, Liwei collected the flowers and made the brew with care.

As he poured the magical brew over his rice paddy, he watched in amazement as the plants suddenly seemed to dance and grow taller before his eyes.

The next morning, Liwei woke up to find his rice paddy transformed into a lush, green paradise. The rice plants flourished, and his harvest was more abundant than ever before.
