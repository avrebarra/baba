Once upon a time, in a cozy village, lived a jolly and cute little girl named Baba. One day, while exploring Grandma's dusty attic, Baba stumbled upon a magical paintbrush. The paintbrush shimmered with an enchanting glow.

Baba's eyes widened in awe. "Wow! What can I paint with this special brush?" she wondered aloud. She picked up the paintbrush and decided to paint the world around her.

With a flick of her wrist, Baba painted a rainbow that stretched across the sky, filling the village with vibrant colors. Birds chirped happily, and flowers bloomed in the meadows at the sight of her magical creation.

But as Baba painted more and more, she got carried away and accidentally painted her little brother's favorite toy blue! "Oh no, what have I done?" she gasped, realizing the mistake.

Baba quickly dipped the brush in golden paint and painted a crown on the toy, turning it into a royal treasure. Her brother's face lit up with joy as he hugged his newly transformed toy tightly.

From then on, Baba learned to use her magical paintbrush wisely, spreading happiness and beauty wherever she went.
