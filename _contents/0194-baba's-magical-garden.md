One sunny morning, Baba was playing in her garden when she discovered a small pouch of magical seeds hidden behind the bushes. "Wow, what could these be?" she wondered with wide eyes.

Curious and excited, Baba decided to plant the seeds in a special spot and watered them every day. Days passed, but nothing happened. Baba started feeling impatient and disappointed, thinking the seeds were just ordinary.

Just when Baba was about to give up, tiny colorful sprouts popped up from the soil. Each day, they grew taller and more vibrant, turning into beautiful flowers that glowed in the dark. Baba's garden transformed into a magical paradise.

"I'm so glad I waited! These flowers are amazing!" Baba exclaimed with pure delight. She learned that good things come to those who are patient and persistent.
