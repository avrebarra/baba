Once upon a time in a lush forest, a friendly hummingbird lived among many animals. This tiny bird worked tirelessly to collect nectar from colorful flowers.

One hot summer day, a big wildfire broke out in the forest. The animals panicked and didn't know what to do. The small hummingbird, with its fast wings and a brave heart, flew to a nearby stream.

The hummingbird dipped its tiny beak into the water and flew back to the fire, sprinkling tiny droplets of water over the flames. Slowly but steadily, the hummingbird repeated this task again and again.

The other animals watched in amazement as the hummingbird's efforts helped to extinguish the fire. They realized that even the smallest creature can make a big difference in times of need.
