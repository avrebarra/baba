Baba loved to spend time in her colorful garden, especially admiring her prized flower that bloomed every morning. But one day, she discovered the flower was missing! "Oh no, where did my flower go?" Baba exclaimed.

Puzzled, Baba searched all around the garden, but the flower was nowhere to be found. She asked her little animal friends for help. "Have you seen my pretty flower?" asked Baba, her eyes filled with worry.

The animals gathered around and shared their ideas on where the flower might be. The wise old owl suggested checking by the big tree, the playful squirrel thought it could be hiding in the bushes, and the busy bee buzzed about looking near the pond.

Working together, Baba and her animal friends followed the clues until they finally found the missing flower tucked away behind the old watering can. "Hooray, we found it!" Baba cheered, grateful for her friends' help.
