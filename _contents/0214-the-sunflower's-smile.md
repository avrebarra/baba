In a colorful garden, there once lived a cheerful sunflower. Every morning, it would greet its garden friends with a big smile, brightening up the entire garden. But one day, the sunflower's smile disappeared, and its petals drooped sadly.

The curious ladybug asked, "Sunflower, why do you look so sad today?" The sunflower sighed, "I have lost my happiness. I miss the warmth of the sun shining on my face." The garden friends huddled together to think of a solution.

The wise old owl suggested, "Let's work together to bring back the sunflower's smile! The squirrel collected shiny pebbles to reflect sunlight, the bird chirped cheerful tunes, and the bunny danced around the sunflower."

Slowly, the sunflower's petals perked up, and a small smile appeared on its face. With the combined efforts of its friends, the sunflower began to bloom again, spreading happiness and warmth throughout the garden.
