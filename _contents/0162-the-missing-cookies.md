Baba had just baked a fresh batch of delicious cookies. She placed them on the kitchen counter to cool down.

When she returned to the kitchen, she was surprised to see that some cookies were missing. "Oh no! My cookies are gone!" she exclaimed.

Baba looked around and noticed her mischievous cat, Whiskers, licking his paws with a guilty look on his face. "Whiskers, did you take my cookies?" she asked.

Whiskers meowed innocently and blinked his big green eyes. Baba decided to investigate further to find the real culprit.

She searched under the table and behind the curtains. Finally, she found her little brother, Timmy, hiding in the pantry with cookie crumbs all around him.

Baba's heart melted when Timmy apologized with a sheepish smile. She forgave him and shared the remaining cookies with him, teaching him the importance of asking nicely before taking things.
