Baba clutched the map tightly, her eyes wide with excitement. "I want to find the treasure, Mama!" she exclaimed, showing her the faded parchment. "Oh my, where do you think it leads, dear?" Mama asked, eyes twinkling with amusement.

The first clue led Baba to the apple tree in the garden. She searched high and low but found nothing. "Hmm, maybe the next clue is nearby," she mused. Following the trail of arrows, she reached the old well, its bricks covered in ivy.

"Oh no, the next clue is stuck in the well!" Baba gasped. She peered down, wondering how to retrieve it. Remembering her toy fishing rod, she cast the line into the depths, hooking the clue and reeling it up with a grin.

With each clue, Baba encountered a small challenge: a locked gate, a muddy puddle, a snoring cat. She solved them all with inventive ideas and a sprinkle of patience. Finally, at the end of the trail, she found a chest filled with shiny marbles and colorful stickers.
