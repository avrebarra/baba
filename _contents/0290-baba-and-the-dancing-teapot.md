Once upon a time, in a cozy little kitchen, Baba was preparing tea when she heard a strange sound. "Clang, clang, clang!" Curious, she peeked into the teapot and to her surprise, it was dancing on the stove!

"Teapot, why are you dancing?" asked Baba with a giggle. The teapot didn't reply but continued its joyful dance, swirling and twirling around the kitchen. Baba tried to catch it, but it was too nimble.

Suddenly, Baba had an idea. She turned on some lively music on the radio, and soon, the teapot was dancing in tune to the beat. They danced together, laughing and twirling around the kitchen.

After a while, the teapot slowly came to a stop, letting out a contented whistle. Baba thanked the teapot for the unexpected dance party and poured herself a cup of tea, feeling happy and full of joy.
