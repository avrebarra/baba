One sunny morning, Baba skipped into her garden to water the flowers. As she watered the plants, she noticed a tiny caterpillar munching on a leaf.

"Hello, little caterpillar," Baba chirped. "Do you like my garden?" The caterpillar nodded, grateful for the tasty treat.

Every day, Baba visited her new friend, watching it grow and change. Finally, one day, the caterpillar disappeared!

Worried, Baba searched high and low until she found it - transformed into a beautiful butterfly! The butterfly fluttered around the garden, sprinkling colorful magic everywhere.

"Wow, you're so pretty now," Baba gasped, eyes wide with wonder. The butterfly landed on her finger, a gentle reminder of the beauty that kindness can bring.
