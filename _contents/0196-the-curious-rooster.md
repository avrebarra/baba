Rusty's feathers stood up as he stumbled upon a shiny, glowing object near the cornfield. "What is this?" he clucked to himself.

"Cock-a-doodle-doo! Look what I found!" Rusty proudly showed the object to his farm friends, causing a commotion.

The object turned out to be a treasure map, sparking excitement among the animals. "Let's follow it and find the hidden treasure!" suggested Rusty.

Along the way, they faced challenges like crossing a swift river and climbing a tall tree. Rusty's curiosity kept them going.

Eventually, they reached a clearing with a chest full of golden corn kernels - a treasure fit for all the hardworking farm animals.
