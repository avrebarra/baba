One day, while playing in her garden, Baba stumbled upon a small pouch filled with colorful seeds. "Hmm, I wonder what these seeds will grow into," she thought curiously.

She decided to plant them in a row, watering them every day and watching them closely. Days passed, but nothing seemed to happen. Baba started to lose hope.

One morning, she woke up to find the seeds had sprouted into vibrant flowers of all colors! "Wow, they bloomed beautifully because I cared for them," Baba exclaimed happily.

The flowers attracted butterflies and birds, making Baba's garden a magical place. She learned that patience and kindness can lead to wondrous surprises.
