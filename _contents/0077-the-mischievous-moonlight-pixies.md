Once upon a time in the great jungle of Fora lived Jia and Rua, two mischievous moonlight pixies known for their playful tricks and bright glowing wings. Every night, they danced across the sky, painting it with shimmering colors.

One evening, as they flew over the sparkling river, they came across a family of fireflies preparing to light up the night. Jia and Rua giggled at the fireflies' efforts, thinking it would be fun to play a prank on them.

The mischievous pixies swooped down, blowing gentle breezes to scatter the fireflies' lights. The fireflies cried out in confusion, unable to light up the night as planned. Jia and Rua laughed, not realizing the upset they caused.

Seeing the fireflies sad, the pixies felt a pang of guilt. Remembering the words of their elders about kindness, Jia and Rua decided to make things right. They joined forces with the fireflies, creating dazzling patterns in the sky that amazed all the creatures of Fora.
