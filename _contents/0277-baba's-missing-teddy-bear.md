One sunny morning, Baba was playing with her toys in her cozy room. She hugged her fluffy teddy bear tightly and then decided to play hide-and-seek with it. "Where did Teddy go?" Baba wondered, looking under the bed and behind the curtains.

"Baba, what's wrong?" asked Mama, noticing Baba's puzzled face. Baba replied, "Teddy is hiding and I can't find him!" Mama smiled and suggested they search together. They checked the toy box, the shelf, and even the laundry basket, but Teddy was nowhere to be found.

Just when Baba was starting to feel sad, Papa came into the room with a big grin. "Look what I found!" he exclaimed, holding up Teddy from behind his back. Baba's face lit up with joy as she hugged Teddy tightly. "Thank you for helping me, Papa!" she said happily.
