One sunny morning, Baba was excited to have toast with honey for breakfast. But when she went to the kitchen, her favorite honey jar was nowhere to be found!

"Oh no! Where did my honey jar go?" Baba said, looking around the kitchen with a puzzled expression.

Baba started searching in every corner of the house but couldn't find the honey jar. She felt sad and confused.

Just then, Baba's little brother, Amos, came into the kitchen, holding the missing honey jar behind his back.

"Amos, did you take my honey jar?" Baba asked, trying to hide her frustration.

Amos looked sheepish and nodded. "I wanted some honey for my oatmeal, but I accidentally dropped it and it broke."

Instead of getting angry, Baba gave Amos a hug and said, "It's okay to make mistakes, but you should always tell the truth. Let's clean up the mess together."

Baba and Amos cleaned up the broken jar and shared the oatmeal with honey from another jar. They learned that honesty and working together can solve any problem.
