One morning, Baba was playing in her backyard when she stumbled upon a soft, cuddly teddy bear lying in the bushes. "Oh my! Who does this belong to?" she wondered aloud.

Baba decided to ask her neighbors if they had lost a teddy bear. However, no one seemed to be missing one. Baba felt worried for the lost bear.

Suddenly, Baba's little brother ran outside, crying. "I lost Teddy! He's my favorite bear!" he sobbed. Baba's eyes widened in realization - this must be his teddy bear!

With a big smile, Baba ran over to the bushes and picked up the teddy bear. "Look what I found, brother! Teddy was hiding in the bushes, but now he's safe," she exclaimed.

Her brother hugged Baba tightly, overjoyed to have Teddy back. Baba felt happy that she could help her brother find his beloved toy, and they both danced around the backyard in glee.
