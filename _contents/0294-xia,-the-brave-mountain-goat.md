In the great Fora jungle, Xia the mountain goat was known for her speed and agility. One day, she heard a distressed cry coming from deep within the jungle. Curious and brave, Xia set off to investigate.

As Xia ventured further, she encountered a baby lion cub trapped in a thorny bush. "Help me, please!" cried the cub. Xia's heart melted at the sight of the scared cub, and she knew she had to help.

Using her swift movements, Xia carefully freed the cub from the thorns. Grateful and relieved, the cub thanked Xia and promised to help her if she ever needed it.

With a warm feeling in her heart, Xia continued her journey through the jungle. As the sun began to set, she found herself surrounded by delicious fruits that the jungle animals had gathered, sharing them as a token of gratitude.
