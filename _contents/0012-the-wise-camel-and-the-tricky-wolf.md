In the heart of the scorching desert, there lived a wise old camel named Amir. He was known throughout the land for his sagacity and keen judgment. One day, while making his way through the towering dunes, Amir encountered a sly wolf named Zahra.

Zahra was charismatic and charming, but Amir could sense something dubious about her. The wolf approached the camel with a friendly smile, weaving tales of friendship and shared goals. Amir listened attentively but remained cautious.

As days passed, Zahra's true colors began to show. She tried to trick Amir into sharing his food and water, claiming it was for the greater good of their friendship. However, the wise camel saw through her deceit and politely declined, safeguarding his provisions.

In the end, Zahra's cunning ways were exposed, and she left the desert in search of an easier target. Amir continued his journey, wiser and more discerning of those who might try to take advantage of his kindness.
