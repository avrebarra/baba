Once upon a time, in a lush forest filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds, there lived a lonely little squirrel named Sammy.

One sunny day, while searching for acorns, Sammy stumbled upon a glowing seed resting on a bed of soft moss. Intrigued, Sammy gently picked up the seed and decided to plant it near his cozy burrow.

Days went by, and Sammy watered the seed with care, hoping it would sprout into something wonderful. One morning, a tiny sprout peeked out of the soil, greeting Sammy with its green leaves.

Excited and curious, Sammy watched over the sprout as it grew taller and stronger each day. To his surprise, the sprout transformed into a lovely flower that emitted a warm, magical glow.

As the flower blossomed, it revealed a smiling face that spoke, "Thank you for your kindness, Sammy. You have nurtured the seed of friendship, and now it shall bloom forever."
