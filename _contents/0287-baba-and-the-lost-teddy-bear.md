One sunny morning, Baba was playing with her toys in her cozy room. She giggled as she hugged her teddy bear tightly.

Suddenly, Baba looked around and realized her teddy bear was nowhere to be found. She searched under the bed, in the toy chest, and even behind the curtains, but the teddy bear was missing.

Worried, Baba went to her mother and said, "Mommy, my teddy bear is gone! Where could it be?"

Her mother smiled and replied, "Let's retrace your steps. Where was the last place you played with it?"

Baba thought for a moment and remembered she was also playing in the living room earlier. She rushed to the living room and there, sitting on the couch, was her lost teddy bear.

With a big smile on her face, Baba hugged her teddy bear and exclaimed, "I found you!"

Her mother reminded her, "Remember to always put your toys back in their place so they don't get lost again."
