Baba loved her pretty pink ribbon that she wore in her hair every day. But one morning, she couldn't find it anywhere in her room.

"Mama, I can't find my ribbon!" Baba said with a frown.

Mama smiled and asked, "Did you check under your pillow? Sometimes things hide there."

Baba looked under her pillow and, lo and behold, there was her ribbon! She giggled with joy and hugged Mama tight.

"Thank you, Mama! I found it in the silly hiding spot," Baba said with a big smile.
