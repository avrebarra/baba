Coco noticed that all her caterpillar friends were climbing trees but she couldn't climb at all. She felt sad and left out.

Determined to find out why she couldn't climb, Coco asked her wise old friend, Mr. Beetle. He explained that she hadn't transformed yet.

Curious Coco asked, "How do I transform?" Mr. Beetle told her that she needed to spin a cocoon and wait patiently.

Coco worked hard spinning her cocoon day and night. Finally, one morning, she emerged as a beautiful butterfly! She could now fly and climb with ease.
