Once upon a time in the lush Fora jungle, Nisha and Kavia, two clever wandering merchant girls, set out on an adventure to find hidden treasures.

As they journeyed deeper into the jungle, they stumbled upon Washa, a wise serpent charmer. Washa's flute playing tamed even the wildest creatures of the jungle.

Curious about Washa's talents, Nisha and Kavia approached him. "Can you teach us how to charm serpents?" they asked eagerly.

Washa smiled and agreed to teach them his secrets. He showed them how to play the enchanted flute and how to communicate with the serpents through music.

The girls practiced diligently, and with Washa's guidance, they soon became skilled serpent charmers themselves. Together, they uncovered the beauty of the jungle and forged an unlikely friendship.
