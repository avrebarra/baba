One sunny morning, Mia the mouse discovered a shiny sunflower seed in the meadow. "What should I do with this seed?" she wondered.

"I'll plant it right here," Mia squeaked as she dug a tiny hole in the soft soil. Day after day, she watered the seed and waited for it to sprout.

Weeks went by, but still, no sunflower grew. "I want to see the sunflower bloom!" Mia exclaimed in frustration.

One rainy day, Mia felt gloomy. But the next morning, she discovered a small sprout peeking out of the ground! With joy, she realized that her sunflower was finally growing.

As the days passed, the sunflower grew taller and the bloom opened up, shining brightly in the sunlight. Mia's persistence had paid off, and her heart swelled with happiness.
