Once in a sunny sea, there lived a colorful rainbow fish named Finn. His scales shimmered like a rainbow, dazzling every creature around.

One day, a shy seahorse named Stella asked, "Finn, your scales are so pretty. Can I have one?" Finn hesitated, worried that he would lose his beauty.

As days passed, Finn noticed his friends drifting away, feeling sad. He realized that sharing his scales could bring happiness to others.

With a brave heart, Finn swam to Stella and said, "Here, you can have one of my scales." Stella's eyes twinkled with delight as she attached the shimmering scale.

Soon, the other sea creatures gathered around in awe, admiring Finn's act of kindness. Finn felt a warmth inside that he had never felt before. From that day on, Finn shared his scales with everyone, making new friends and spreading joy throughout the sea.
